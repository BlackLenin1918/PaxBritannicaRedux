  # IDEAS
  ##########################
  PB_CHI_Extraterrorialities:0 "Extraterritorial Excesses"
  PB_CHI_Extraterrorialities_desc:0 "Since the Opium Wars and the Boxer Rebellion, China has found itself carved up into spheres of influence by the European powers. Thousands of foreigners are effectively above Chinese law, and foreign businesses are granted preferential trade treatment by corrupt provincial governors. With millions of Wen tied up in these extraterritorialities and the corruption associated with them, the Chinese economy is badly constricted."
  PB_CHI_Regionalism:0 "Rampant Regionalism"
  PB_CHI_Regionalism_desc:0 "Regionalism has become a rampant problem thoughout the Chinese Empire. What first began as a method of decentralized governance in the rebellious Western provinces has snowballed completely out of control. Now, vast territories of the Empire are ruled by military governors and local cliques like petty kings, only tacitly acknowledging the central government in Beijing. This makes it nearly impossible to raise a modern conscript army, and greatly reduces any organization such an army might have."
  PB_CHI_Agrarian_Economy:0 "Agrarian Economy"
  PB_CHI_Agrarian_Economy_desc:0 "Industrialization has been slow to arrive in the Middle Kingdom. While imported European methods for farming and mechanized production have found success in the populated coastlines, the vast majority of the country still depends on medieval and unreliable subsistence farming or artisan methods of production. This has made the Chinese economy woefully uncompetetive and stalled any attempts at modernizing."
  PB_CHI_Revolutionary_Fervor:0 "Revolutionary Fervor"
  PB_CHI_Revolutionary_Fervor_desc:0 "China is in a state of crisis. The moribund Qing government is wholly incapable of managing the nation. People are hungry, despotic regional governors extract taxes on a whim for lavish parties, and bandits terrorize the rural populace without a proper police force. Nationalist rebels in Mongolia and Xinjiang appear with an uneasy regularity, while riots and violence grip major cities. The touchpaper of revolution has been lit, and the Chinese Empire is poised to explode into chaos at the drop of a hat."
  PB_CHI_Extraterritorial_Dividends:0 "Extraterritorial Dividends"
  PB_CHI_Extraterritorial_Dividends_desc:0 "This nation benefits from the series of unequal treaties the Qing Empire signed with the European powers during the mid-late 1800s. These treaties grant the European powers legal immunity within their claimed territories, as well as allowing them to heavily invest in the region without needing to pay Chinese taxes. Due to this, the treaties have allowed many European powers to establish large corporate and industrial bases in Chinese cities, though at the considerable detriment of the Chinese Empire."

  PB_CHI_Warlords:0 "Managing Warlordism"
  PB_CHI_Warlords_desc:0 "\nThe hands-off domestic policies of the Qing Empire, while they have bought stability in the short term, have severely hampered the country in the long term. Many provinces are ruled over as independent states in all but name by local governors and military cliques. The ultimate result of this is that the nation is deeply splintered along ideological, ethnic, and economic lines. Not every warlord is aligned to the central Peking government, which could prove precarious in the long term if not rectified.\n\n§YWarlord Alignment§! is an indication of which political faction, if any, a warlord is aligned with.\n\n§YWarlord Power§! indicates how much local authority a warlord holds over their native province, which can be leveraged against the government that controls said province."

  CHI_Pacify_Guangxi:0 "Pacify Guangxi"
  CHI_Pacify_Guangxi_desc:0 "The Guangxi and Guangdong Region of Southern China was one of the central hubs of the Revolutionaries during the conflict. Even now, former revolutionaries hide out in the countryside, attacking the local Qing garrison and damaging infrastructure. They must be dealt with, however the continuing popularity of the revolutionaries and their entrenched positions will make this campaign a costly one."
  CHI_Pacify_Yunnan:0 "Pacify Yunnan"
  CHI_Pacify_Yunnan_desc:0 "The Yunnan Province was the central hub of the aborted Chinese uprisings, and thus it is one of the most highly defended territories we control. The province's position on the periphery of the Empire has made it difficult to control, but even now the insurgency draws strength from Burmese and ethnic rebels across the porous border. This region must be brought back under the complete control of the Empire."
  CHI_Pacify_Sichuan:0 "Pacify Sichuan"
  CHI_Pacify_Sichuan_desc:0 "Though Sichuan joined the Revolutionary alliance, their allegiance to them was more pragmatic than ideological.

  qing.1.t:0 "The Beginning of Chinese New Year"
  qing.1.d:0 "Today marks the beginning of Chinese New Year, and as festivities kick off throughout the Empire, disturbing reports have reached imperial authorities. Spies within various nationalist and revolutionary movements have reported that the enigmatic National Revolutionary Alliance group are using the holiday as an opportunity to stockpile explosives and munitions.\n\nThough we haven't confirmed these reports, it may be wise to remain on high alert throughout the holiday on the off chance that these rabble-rousers attempt anything."
  qing.1.a:0 "Surely these reports can't be accurate."

  qing.2.t:0 "Explosions Reported in Wuchang"
  qing.2.d:0 "In the midst of celebrations in Wuchang, a series of explosions were reported near the city center. Police rushed to the scene of the event, discovering multiple warehouses ablaze and nearly a hundred people injured. Though initially it was believed the event was caused by an accidental fireworks explosion, further investigation has found that four warehouses in the city had been stocked to their roofs with military grade materials.\n\nPolice have located at least three other warehouses across the province with similar contents, which has lead General Xun to order the deployment of Imperial troops to Hubei in anticipation of an armed uprising. Police recovered documents from several warehouses which, though badly burned, implicate members of multiple provincial governments in the illegal weapons stockpiling."

  qing.7.d:0 "The situation in Southern China has developed not necessarily to the advantage of Imperial forces. The declaration of martial law did little to curb the ongoing civil unrest. Instead, it simply intensified the fighting between local authorities and the revolutionaries. The streets of dozens of cities are bathed in blood as disorganzied militias and Qing authorities clash in intense urban warfare. Efforts to get the military involved have similarly backfired, as a large number of generals and officers have defected to the revolutionaries.\n\nIncidents are sparking all throughout the nation and it is increasingly clear that the Empire faces her greatest crisis since the Taiping Rebellion. Loyalist forces muster around Field Marshall Sun Chuanfang, while the rebellious forces ally themselves with Cai E and his revolutionary clique. Reports on the periphery of Imperial territory indicate that separatists have launched probing attacks against provincial capitals, indicating the likelihood of general revolt. The future of the Empire and, indeed, the whole of China is at stake in this darkest hour."
