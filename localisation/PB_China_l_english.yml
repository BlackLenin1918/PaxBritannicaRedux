 CHI_Chiang_Seizes_Control_tooltip:0 "§RChiang kai Shek has seized control of the Yuan.§!\n"
 CHI_Chiang_Dictatorship_desc:0 "Chiang’s Beijing Clique has seized control, taking power from the Legislative Yuan and vesting it into a new military junta. As the new military dictator of the Chinese Republic, Chiang and his associates must now decide the path for the Republic."

 CHI_Progressive_Reform:0 "The Progressive Recovery Plan"
 CHI_SocDem_Economic_Plan_tooltip:0 "§GThe Progressive Kuomintang Recovery Plan has been voted in.§!\n"

 CHI_Conservative_Reform_desc:0 "The Conservative Wing of the Kuomintang has won out in the Yuan, and will be able to institute their relief plan unimpeded."

 CHI_Public_Works:0 "The Public Works Programme"
 CHI_Public_Works_desc:0 "With millions unemployed virtually overnight, we’re facing a major crisis with getting people into jobs. A potential remedy for this plan, at least temporarily, is the creation of vast public works programmes. China’s infrastructure and industrial base is already underwhelming at best, so such an ambitious plan could solve two problems."

 CHI_National_Education:0 "National Bureau of Education"
 CHI_National_Education_desc:0 "China’s population has suffered from a lack of easily accessible education. Illiteracy has run rampant in the interior, and even on the more developed coast, skilled labour is hard to come by. Expanding our public education system to be more available to the population should be a key factor in combatting unemployment from the Crisis."

 CHI_Zhongkai_Welfare_Plan:0 "Zhongkai's Welfare Plan"
 CHI_Zhongkai_Welfare_Plan_desc:0 "Welfare has been made a dirty word in some circles. Current Prime Minister Zhongkai disagrees. The Prime Minister has proposed a comprehensive welfare programme to provide aid to our population. The plan is ambitious, allowing for the creation of a National Labour Bureau and expanding the moldering Chinese taxation system to help redistribute wealth out to the population."

 CHI_Examine_the_Army_Progressive:0 "Examine the Army"
 CHI_Examine_the_Army_Progressive_desc:0 "The Chinese Army is underwhelming in many regards. Torn by regionalism and squabbling, backbiting commanders, the army is extremely inefficient. We should look to reforming it and trying to modernize."

 CHI_Interior_Development:0 "The Infrastructure Development Plan"
 PB_CHI_Interior_Development.tt:0 "£decision_icon_small §GUnlocks Decisions for the Interior Development Plan§!\n"
 CHI_Interior_Development_desc:0 "It’s not secret that the interior of China is underdeveloped. Some impoverished citizens haven’t even seen a car. We need to rectify this. The Yuan has been presented with a long-term plan to develop various regions of China and modernize them with public transportation."

 CHI_Court_Unions:0 "Court the Labour Unions"
 CHI_Court_Unions_desc:0 "Labour Relations in China have been a point of contention between the different wings of the Kuomintang. We should seek to mend ties with the Labour groups, particularly in Beijing, to try and keep tensions as low as possible."

 CHI_Balance_Budget:0 "Balance the Budget"
 CHI_Balance_Budget_desc:0 "The Republic has been spending far too much capital on a menagerie of programmes. Many of them are either redundant or pointless. We need to cut down on our spending overall and tighten our belts. "

 CHI_Limited_Intervention:0 "Limited Interventionism"
 CHI_Limited_Intervention_desc:0 "The great chain of the Market is vital to the economy. We should focus less on intervention in the economy and more on trying to maintain a small, but efficient government. The market knows best."

 CHI_National_Bank:0 "Establish the National Bank of China"
 CHI_National_Bank_desc:0 "China isn’t exactly a center of banking or finance. While that isn’t exactly going to change any time soon, we should establish a national bank to try and mitigate some of the issues incurred by the crisis. If we’re able to better provide investment loans to startups, we could begin to foster Chinese commerce and shake off our dependency on French and British economics."

 CHI_KMT_Youth:0 "The Kuomintang Youth"
 CHI_KMT_Youth_desc:0 "Our youth are our future, and the Kuomintang has done little to try and win the hearts and minds of young Chinese people. The proposed KMT Youth troops would be an excellent way to not only teach the Chinese youth practical skills, but also to try and encourage loyalty to both wings of the party when elections roll around."

 CHI_Foreign_Investors:0 "Seek New Foreign Investors"
 CHI_Foreign_Investors_desc:0 "We’re reliant on foreign investors, unfortunately, and that’s not likely to change soon. While many of the companies reliant on outside investors have gone under, the companies in their home countries haven’t. We should see if we can woo outside companies and governments to return to Nanjing, hopefully with open wallets."

 CHI_Examine_the_Army_Conservative:0 "Examine the Army"
 CHI_Examine_the_Army_Conservative_desc:0 "The Chinese Army is underwhelming in many regards. Torn by regionalism and squabbling, backbiting commanders, the army is extremely inefficient. We should look to reforming it and trying to modernize."

 CHI_New_China:0 "The New China"
 CHI_New_China_desc:0 "We’ve completed our reforms and finally stabilized the economy. We can now refocus our efforts on keeping the Republic together and establishing our policies towards the rest of Asia and the world."

 CHI_Suffrage_Movement:0 "Examine the Suffrage Movement"
 CHI_Suffrage_Movement_desc:0 "While the Women’s suffrage movement has been slow to reach China, there are already some vocal elements of our society pushing for it. Traditionalists might dislike it, but we should certainly at least take a look at the movement and see if there is anything of value."

 CHI_Golden_Cinema:0 "Cinematic Golden Age"
 CHI_Golden_Cinema_desc:0 "The art of Cinema and filmmaking is nascent in China, and we should work to encourage it. Taking home wins at Film Festivals might not win us any wars, but they will certainly help China’s prestige as a world power."

 CHI_Student_Movement:0 "Embrace the Student Movement"
 CHI_Student_Movement_desc:0 "Students in China have been on the move for years. There are political activists on both sides of the spectrum, organizing protests and marches for this ideal or that. We should examine these Student Movements and decide what the government line is on them, whether it be support or condemnation."

 CHI_Nanjing_Academy:0 "The Nanjing Military Academy"
 CHI_Nanjing_Academy_desc:0 "Chinese generalship is inconsistent at times. While the French and British might have their own military academies, we lack centralization in regards to military education. Establishing a major military academy in Nanjing would help us better educate our officers and generals in the art of war."

 CHI_Sun_Legacy:0 "Sun Yat-sen's Legacy"
 CHI_Sun_Legacy_desc:0 "Sun Yat-sen spent his life fighting against the Qing imperial dynasty, and is revered as the Father of the Nation by many. His guidance is widely believed to have kept China from falling to autocracy. Though he didn’t live to see his dreams come to fruition, we should nonetheless honor the nation’s father through our maintenance of Chinese democracy."

 CHI_Livelihood:0 "The People's Livelihood"
 CHI_Livelihood_desc:0 "The Livelihood of our people is paramount. Sun Yat-sen believed that the Chinese Republic should have systems of social support, ensuring that the people are always assisted in some degree by the government. Though the details of this are debated within the KMT, it is a central pillar of the Republican government."

 CHI_Democracy:0 "The People's Democracy"
 CHI_Democracy_desc:0 "Sun Yat-sen fought for democracy against the autocratic Qing government, and so shall we. We must be ever vigilant against autocratic elements within the nation, and must act to prevent them from taking power away from the people. An emperor will never again rule over the Chinese people."

 CHI_Nationalism:0 "The People's Nation"
 CHI_Nationalism_desc:0 "Protecting the democracy of China is the duty of every citizen. China must always be vigilant against those around them who might seek to throttle the ideals of the people. The maintenance of our republic must always be protected, whether that be by rhetoric or rifles."

 CHI_Chiang_KMT:0 "Chiang's Kuomintang"
 CHI_Chiang_KMT_desc:0 "An unrestricted democracy is no better than anarchy. The Kuomintang must act not as just a party in the system, but as the party managing the system. China must shift towards a managed democracy, with, naturally, Chiang and his party at the helm."

 CHI_Army_Favours:0 "Maintain the Army's Favour"
 CHI_Army_Favours_desc:0 "The army may have facilitated Chiang’s seizure of power, but their loyalty may fade over time. We must continue to keep the loyalty of the army on the side of Chiang and the KMT."

 CHI_Purge_Leftists:0 "Purge the Leftists"
 CHI_Purge_Leftists_desc:0 "Communism must never be allowed to take hold in China. Anyone espousing leftist ideals must be arrested and dealt with, post haste."

 CHI_Rewrite_Constitution:0 "Rewrite the Constitution"
 CHI_Rewrite_Constitution_desc:0 "The old Republican constitution is outdated. With Chiang’s new government stabilized, at least for now, we should turn our attentions to how the new government shall be maintained. Many different groups and interests have come out of the woodwork to seek power."

 CHI_Communist_Counter_Coup:0 "Lisan's Counter Coup"
 CHI_Communist_Counter_Coup_tooltip:0 "§RLi Lisan and the CPC have seized control of the apparatus of state.§!\n"

 CHI_proclaim_PRC_tooltip:0 "§RYou will become the Chinese Soviet Republic§!\n"

 CHI_Social_Republic:0 "The Chinese Social Republic"
 CHI_Social_Republic_desc:0 "Chiang’s ideals didn’t go far enough. Or, at least, that’s what the Blueshirts and Wang Jingwei think. Jingwei is a proponent of Chinese ultranationalism, believing that the Republic must be reorganized around racial principles. According to Jingwei, the Han Chinese are the chosen people to rule China, and must act as such."
 CHI_Wang_Jingwei_Leads_China_tooltip:0 "§GWang Jingwei and the Blueshirts lead the New Republic§!\n"

 CHI_Emperor_Chiang:0 "Emperor Chiang I"
 CHI_Emperor_Chiang_desc:0 "Chiang was never going to be satisfied with simply being the military dictator of China. No, he has much larger ambitions. Much like Yuan Shikai who came before him, Chiang will proclaim himself the new Emperor of the Chinese Empire."
 CHI_Chiang_Becomes_Emperor_tooltip:0 "§GChiang kai Shek has become Emperor of China§!\n"

 CHI_Military_Junta:0 "President for Life"
 CHI_Military_Junta_desc:0 "Democracy is overrated, and the communists are still a major threat despite the purges. Chiang will act as the permanent president of the Chinese republic, in order to maintain peace and stability for the nation."
 CHI_Military_Junta_tooltip:0 "§GChiang kai Shek formally establishes a military junta§!\n"

 CHI_Emperor_Returns:0 "The Emperor Strikes Back"
 CHI_Emperor_Returns_desc:0 "The end of the Qing dynasty marked a period of long-term decline for the Chinese nation. Our true leader, Pu yi, has spent his entire life languishing in French Indochina. To restore the monarchy would bring greater stability to the Chinese nation, even if some Republicans find it heretical."
 CHI_Emperor_Returns_tooltip:0 "§GPu Yi has been reinstalled as Emperor of China§!\n"

 CHI_Suppression_Campaign:0 "National Suppression Campaigns"
 CHI_Suppression_Campaign_desc:0 "Securing the new Chinese state should be a top priority. To accomplish this, Blueshirt Pacification Squads are to be sent out to roundup any resistance to our new government. The faster we deal with dissidents today, the less we deal with them when the real work begins."

 CHI_Traditional_Values:0 "Traditional Values"
 CHI_Traditional_Values_desc:0 "The family and the nation should be valued above all others in the new China. We must reverse the decades of so-called progressivism that has torn the Chinese people asunder."

 CHI_China_for_Chinese:0 "China for the Chinese"
 CHI_China_for_Chinese_desc:0 "The Han Chinese peoples are the chosen masters of the Chinese nation, and we should act as such. Those who are not of pure Chinese blood have no place in the new China. They should be rounded up and handled as efficiently, and swiftly, as possible. Ethnic Resettlement of non-Han Chinese will begin immediately, along with disarmament of the regional militias to prevent resistance."

 CHI_Politics_Research_Clique:0 "The Politics Research Clique"
 CHI_Politics_Research_Clique_desc:0 "Maintaining the authority of the Chiang government is paramount. To accomplish this, a group of officers and political theorists have assembled the Politics Research Clique, in order to maintain the thin veneer of democracy for the people. "

 CHI_New_Life_Movement:0 "The New Life Movement"
 CHI_New_Life_Movement_desc:0 "In order to counter the influences of the Chinese communists, we must promote the values of the new regime. To accomplish this, we must promote the New Life Movement. Based in neo-Confucian ideals, the New Life Movement will push our citizens to live their lives based on the principles of the proper rite, justice, honesty, and morality. And of course to ensure they remain loyal to Chiang."

 CHI_White_Terror:0 "The White Terror"
 CHI_White_Terror_desc:0 "The Communists must always be kept on their toes. The purges and arrests can never end if we are to vanguard the Chinese people from the dangers of godless bolshevism. The old Republic allowed the Leftists to gain power far too often, and they became complacent and were overthrown. We must not make the same mistake."

 CHI_Cult_of_Personality:0 "Encourage Personality Cult"
 CHI_Cult_of_Personality_desc:0 "Our glorious leader, Chiang kai Shek, is wise in all regards. With one hand, he has reforged the Chinese nation as a bulwark against Communism and Japanese aggression. With the other, he wields the righteous sword against those that would do China harm. We must give praise to our glorious leader for his protection and insights."

 CHI_Emperor_Loyalty:0 "Loyalty to the Emperor"
 CHI_Emperor_Loyalty_desc:0 "The old Qing Empire was overthrown by the military, and if the new Emperor is to maintain power, he must maintain their favor. Loyalty must be to the Emperor, above all others."

 CHI_Imperial_Research:0 "The Imperial Research Academy"
 CHI_Imperial_Research_desc:0 "The Emperor is generous, and his people need his help. Rampant illiteracy has made the Chinese people weak, and this cannot be allowed to continue. The Imperial Research Academy must be established to promote science and progress for the nation."

 CHI_Border_Restoration:0 "Restore the Qing Border"
 CHI_Border_Restoration_desc:0 "Much of the former imperial territories remain occupied by separatist movements. Reclaiming these regions should be paramount to restoring the former Chinese Empire. Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang. All must swear their loyalty to the emperor, and the emperor alone."

 CHI_Civil_War_Aftermath.tt:0 "£decision_icon_small §G We can now make postwar reconstruction decisions .§!\n"

 CHI_Ban_Communist_Party:0 "Ban the Communist Party"
 CHI_Ban_Communist_Party_desc:0 "Communism is an existential threat to our society, and must be treated as such. Our victory in the war has left us with many communists in chains, and some even sided with our government against their more radical compatriots. The CPC, even its moderate branch, cannot be allowed to continue operating."

 CHI_Integrate_Communists:0 "Re-Integrate the Communist Party"
 CHI_Integrate_Communists_desc:0 "Many moderate communists fled to our banner when the CPC declared their revolution. This kind of loyalty to the Chinese people cannot be overlooked. We can abide the CPC’s continuing operation, but we should ensure that their more moderate, Lisanist branch is kept from taking power ever again."

 CHI_National_Aid_Program:0 "National Aid Program"
 CHI_National_Aid_Program_desc:0 "Much of our infrastructure is destroyed or non-operational. We need to get civilian industry moving again and begin reconnecting disparate elements of the country that were disconnected because of the loss of the railways."

 CHI_Consolidate_Power:0 "Consolidate Power"
 CHI_Consolidate_Power_desc:0 "With China secure, we can begin consolidating power away from the old Republican systems and towards our new, more authoritative designs. "

 CHI_Three_Principles_Prevail:0 "The Three Principles Prevail"
 CHI_Three_Principles_Prevail_desc:0 "The Democratic government has secured a victory for China, and thus a victory for self-government across all of Asia. Sun Yat-sen’s principles guided our victory, and thus we should further encourage their adoption across our controlled territories."

 CHI_Western_Expedition:0 "The Western Expedition"
 CHI_Western_Expedition_desc:0 "Yunnan was among the first nations to seize independence from China. Under their military autocracy, they control a vital trade corridor into the Indian subcontinent. The army of Yunnan is small, and thus easily defeated. We should seize on the opportunity while we can."

 CHI_Further_West:0 "Push Further West"
 CHI_Further_West_desc:0 "The Ma Clique, controlled by the Ma families, declared independence early into the Civil War. We need to reacquire their territory to secure a path further west, and allow us to finally strike down the Western separatist movements."

 CHI_End_Tibet:0 "End the Tibetan Question"
 CHI_End_Tibet_desc:0 "Tibet has been a part of China to varying degrees throughout the centuries. Controlling the region will be vital for any future plans we might have to strike into India and the Himalayas."

 CHI_Suppress_Ma_Muslims:0 "Suppress the Ma Muslims"
 CHI_Suppress_Ma_Muslims_desc:0 "One of the key reasons why the Ma broke away was their distinct cultural and religious heritage. Crushing that distinct cultural and religious heritage should thus be a key part of our re-integration of the region. There will be no tolerance for traitors."

 CHI_Compromise_with_Ma:0 "Compromise with the Ma Families"
 CHI_Compromise_with_Ma_desc:0 "The distinctness of the Ma region has always been a point of contention with the Nanjing government. While we cannot allow them to remain independent, we could perhaps make a deal with the families to allow them a degree of autonomy under the Chinese banner."

 CHI_Abolish_Tibet_Parliament:0 "Abolish the Tibetan Parliament"
 CHI_Abolish_Tibet_Parliament_desc:0 "Tibet? What Tibet. All that’s ever been here are good, patriotic, Chinese citizens of the highest caliber. Dali Lama? Never heard of him."

 CHI_Approach_Tibet_Parliament:0 "Approach the Tibetan Parliament"
 CHI_Approach_Tibet_Parliament_desc:0 "Tibet is culturally distinct from the rest of China, and that should be something we account for in how the region is administrated. We should approach the local Tibetan parliament and try to make an arrangement to grant them limited autonomy as a region of China."

 CHI_Northern_Expedition:0 "The Great Northern Expedition"
 CHI_Northern_Expedition_desc:0 "With the weaker regions of China deal with, we can move on to reclaiming the North. Mongolia seized a great deal of territory from us when the Civil War began, so reclaiming it from them should be a top priority."

 CHI_Great_Western_Expedition:0 "The Great Western Expedition"
 CHI_Great_Western_Expedition_desc:0 "Xinjiang has been a thorn in our side since the Shikai era. A rogue state of ethnic separatists is more than just a threat to China, but also a threat to the stability of Asia as a whole. They must be dealt with."

 CHI_Push_East:0 "Push East"
 CHI_Push_East_desc:0 "Manchuria represents more than just a rogue state, it represents the ability to project power into Siberia and beyond. Zoulin’s personal fiefdom cannot be allowed to persist if we intend to reassert our control over our former territories."

 CHI_Five_Races_One_Flag:0 "Five Races under One Flag"
 CHI_Five_Races_One_Flag_desc:0 "China is together once more. With the separatist regions dealt with and the most unruly groups either pacified or re-integrated, we can once again endeavor to maintain Chinese power in Asia. Onwards, friends! To victory!"

 CHI_Foreign_Ministry_desc:0 "With growing tension throughout the world, China’s diplomatic isolationism is beginning to look like a quaint relic of an ancient time. We need to reconsider our existing policies, and see if we need to look abroad for further support."

 CHI_World_Stage:0 "China on the World Stage"
 CHI_World_Stage_desc:0 "China cannot stand alone against predatory enemies. We must look outwards, to the old empires in France and Britain, to assist us."

 CHI_Standing_Alone:0 "China Stands Alone"
 CHI_Standing_Alone_desc:0 "We simply cannot trust the European powers to act in our interests. China must stand on her own against her enemies, and must endeavor to assert herself as the dominant power in Asia, whether that be by diplomacy or by lead."

 CHI_Ally_Britain:0 "Friends in High Places"
 CHI_Ally_Britain_desc:0 "The French Empire has pillaged China for centuries, and thus we should look to their natural rivals, the British Empire. Gaining the favor of the preeminent world power would be a great boon for China, even if London is just the lesser of two evils."

 CHI_Ally_France:0 "Better The Devil You Know"
 CHI_Ally_France_desc:0 "The French already have an existing presence in the Pacific. Collaboration with the French Empire may be unpopular, but they are already here, and will likely be more than willing to work with us, even if it means we’ll be undermining our national sovereignty."

 CHI_London_Institute:0 "The London-Nanjing Institute"
 CHI_London_Institute_desc:0 "British science has propelled the world forward since the Great War, and China would to well to bring such science to her borders. We should seek to establish a branch of the London Institute in Nanjing, to encourage progress throughout the entire nation."

 CHI_Royal_Navy_Advisors_desc:0 "China’s navy has always been a vestigial part of the military, but with Japan’s ambitions for the Pacific growing by the day, we must act to protect ourselves.

 CHI_Negotiate_Hong_Kong:0 "The Hong Kong Gambit"
 CHI_Negotiate_Hong_Kong_desc:0 "Hong Kong has been a source of humiliation for China for centuries. Seized by the French after the Opium Wars, it has been their chief method by which to push Opium into Southern China. Britain is now friend of the French, so perhaps we could use their support to push for the return of Hong Kong?"

 CHI_French_Opium_Crackdown:0 "Crack down on French Opium"
 CHI_French_Opium_Crackdown_desc:0 "Opium is a plague on Chinese society, and it all stems from French traders. We need to expel the French opium trade from Guangdong if we ever intend on expanding our military and stabilizing the nation."

 CHI_Join_Commonwealth:0 "Join the Commonwealth"
 CHI_Join_Commonwealth_desc:0 "We have most certainly shown our usefulness to the British as a counterbalance to French power in the Pacific. Formalizing this alliance should be the finale of our alignment towards London."

 CHI_France_Science_Committee:0 "Join the Comité scientifique impérial"
 CHI_France_Science_Committee_desc:0 "The French lead the world in several key areas of research. We should see if the French Empire would be willing to expand their research network to the Far East. It would greatly propel our modernization efforts."

 CHI_France_Discuss_Opium:0 "Disuss the Opium Trade"
 CHI_France_Discuss_Opium_desc:0 "The Opium trade in Guangdong is a problem, no doubt, but the French are surely pragmatic. We should see if we can establish some new arrangement that doesn’t involve state-sponsored drug trading."

 CHI_France_Bargain_for_Treaty_Ports_desc:0 "The treaty port in Hong Kong is a key port for access to Southeast Asia. The French have held it since the fall of the Qing Empire.

 CHI_Join_Imperial_Entente:0 "Join the Imperial Entente"
 CHI_Join_Imperial_Entente_desc:0 "The French have surely seen our devotion to the Imperial cause. We could formally consolidate our alliance with them by joining the Imperial Entente."

 CHI_Chinese_Economic_Bloc:0 "The Chinese Economic Bloc"

 CHI_Greater_China_desc:0 "China was far greater an imperial regime. We should act to expand our influence military throughout Asia and beyond, taking back our national pride through military force. The middle kingdom is the true leader of Asia, and we should act as such."

 CHI_Ministry_of_State_Security_desc:0 "It’s no secret that we have constant problems with internal security.

 CHI_Integrate_Regional_Militias:0 "Integrate the Regional Militias"
 CHI_Integrate_Regional_Militias_desc:0 "Many of the autonomous regions that were created after the fall of Yuan Shikai have their own militias.

 china.1.d:0 "With the economic crisis in full swing, an emergency session of the Legislative Yuan has been called to try and address the issue. Chen Gongbo of the Conservative wing of the KMT has put forward his party’s plan, which seeks to push the Chinese economy towards a more free market. The Progressive KMT, under the incumbent Zhongkai, have pushed for their own plan to further nationalize key industries and implement more welfare policies. Strong rhetoric has come from both parties, and fears have come up that the Yuan might become gridlocked at the worst time possible."

 china.3.a:0 "Better than nothing, at least."
 china.4.t:0 "The Beijing Clique"
 china.4.d:0 "While the Yuan remains gridlocked on a recovery plan, reports of conspiracy have arrived from Beijing. Field Marshal Chiang kai Shek and a small cadre of officers have reportedly been vocal about their intent to “maintain the stability of China” if the Yuan cannot come to a decision. Though some have dismissed the Clique as a mere rumor, Sun Fo and the Xinhai Republicans have voiced concerns that Chiang may have more insidious motives than simply “protecting China.”"

 china.5.t:0 "Chiang tries to overthrow the Government"
 china.5.d:0 "Crisis as Chiang kai Shek attempts to storm the Yuan. Military and police have moved through Nanjing, seizing control of any suspected loyalist holdouts. Chiang, along with his close ally Yan Xishan, announced to the captive Yuan that they have failed to protect the people of China from not just the communists, but from their own inept governance. Chiang stated that he intends to disband the Yuan and declare a military government in order to protect the Chinese people. At the same time, loyalists have mobilized on the capital with the intent to reverse the Beijing Clique’s coup."

 china.6.d:0 "Chiang kai Shek and his supporters have been arrested by the Loyalists, but crisis looms over China. Li Lisan, speaking to a crowd of thousands in Beijing, announced his intent to mobilize the Red Guard militias. The Red Guards, mostly composed of students and radicals, have previously helped protect labour strikes. Now, they patrol the streets of Beijing armed with rifles and clubs. Conflicts with the local authorities have begun to escalate. Several administrative buildings have already been burnt down and our advisors are demanding we take military action."

 china.7.t:0 "Lisan declares the people's revolution."
 china.7.d:0 "In response to Field Marshall Chiang’s failed coup against the Yuan, Li Lisan and the CPC have declared that China has failed as a nation. In a rousing speech on the steps of the Beijing capital building, Lisan announced his intent to bring the worker’s revolution to China, by force if necessary. Red Guard militias have already begun to mobilize throughout the North, seizing control of infrastructure and attacking us in guerrilla raids. Lisan shows no signs of standing down, and therefore neither can we."

 china.9.t:0 "Examining the Army"
 china.9.d:0 "The Chinese army has been wracked with corruption and ineptitude for decades. Cronyism has become a serious issue among many so-called military cliques. If we are to project power and defend ourselves, we must look towards reforming our army more extensively."

Not only will this provide a boon to our employment rate, but it will also allow us to more easily field manpower and materiel to areas where we previously had difficulty doing so. Prime Minister Zhongkai announced the project with the announcement of the “Trans-Interior Railway”, which is projected to span the typically underdeveloped regions of interior China. "
 china.10.a:0 "Onwards to modernity!"
 china.11.t:0 "The Communist Counter-Coup!"
 china.11.d:0 "In light of the recent power grab by the Beijing Clique, elements of the army sympathetic to the communist cause have attempted a counter-coup against Chiang’s military government. Little more than a disorganized mob, they have attempted to seize control of the new government. Li Lisan, though still overseeing a protest in Beijing, has openly announced his support of the coup."

 china.17.d:0 "The Infrastructure Development Plan has been completed! After five months of progress, the infrastructure of China has been steadily improved. The project has been heralded as a major success by the Zhongkai government, and even received some praise from the conservative minority. With the program completed, we can continue to further develop our infrastructure to meet the needs of the people."
 china.17.a:0 "Truly a great achievement!"
 china.18.t:0 "The Beijing Labour Conference"
 china.18.d:0 "In an attempt to try and reach a common ground with the Communists and the Labour movement, we have brought together leaders from both sides in Beijing to reach an agreement on worker’s rights for the future. Among the attendees was Li Lisan, current head of the Chinese Communist Party, and Zhang Wentian, current head of the Chinese Industrial Workers Union, one of the largest unions in the nation. After many days of deliberation, a list of terms and demands have been put forward by those in the Labour Movement. Among these include the establishment of an eight hour work week, and requests to push for laws preventing crackdowns on strikes. Conservatives have been vocal in their distaste for the entire affair, and public support for the Conference is shaky at best. If we fully agree to their demands, the incumbent government could be seen as weak. If we reject them outright, we could risk galvanizing the hardline leftists into action."
 china.18.a:0 "Agree to all of their requests"
 china.18.b:0 "Reach a compromise"
 china.18.c:0 "Reject all the requests entirely"
 china.19.t:0 "Seeking Foreign Investments"
 china.19.d:0 "As part of our economic plan, we need to look beyond China. Our economy has always been heavily dependent on foreign investments, and that is unlikely to change any time soon. Our advisors have lined up a group of investment groups and corporations from abroad that we can choose between. The British Imperial Investment Corporation would bring us closer to the British Empire’s sphere of influence and assist in naval production. The French FAMH is favored towards industrial development, but given our history with the French, would be less than accepted publicly. There is also the Japanese Matetsu railway company, which could increase our infrastructure, but would be widely opposed given Japan’s stance towards us."

 china.19.b:0 "FAMH"
 china.19.c:0 "Mantetsu"
 china.20.t:0 "Democracy Preserved"
 china.20.d:0 "History is often written as a series of events that happened, rather than events that didn’t. This is one such occasion. Our nation, ravaged by constant war and conquest, has finally been able to stand on it’s own against internal strife and external threats. Lisan and the communists have been pacified, at least for now, and we can turn our attentions to the outside world. From the steps of the capital, [Root.GetLeader] announced plans to begin pursuing an expanded foreign policy and abandoning Chinese isolationism. In a rousing speech, [Root.GetLeader] stated firmly that “We have stood up, and soon we shall stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the great powers of Europe and beyond.”"
 china.20.a:0 "We have stood up, indeed."
 china.21.t:0 "The 1940 Legislative Yuan Elections"
 china.21.d:0 "The term of current Prime Minister, Liao Zhongkai, has come to a conclusion. The parliament has been dissolved in preparation for the 1940 Legislative Yuan election cycle. The Progressive Wing of the Kuomintang is anticipated to maintain their majority, however some believe that the Conservative KMT might be able to overturn their eight year hegemony. Additionally, the liberal Xinhai Republicans, spearheaded by Sun Fo, are believe to be making plays at control over the parliament.w"

 china.22.a:0 "Zhongkai earns a second term!"
 china.22.b:0 "Zhang Lan takes the vote!"

 china.23.t:0 "Leadership Elections for the Conservative KMT"
 china.23.d:0 "The Conservative KMT have gained control of the Legislative Yuan, and must now elect a new Prime Minister. Chen Gongbo has been the party leader for almost ten years and is anticipating a win. Party newcomer Chiang kai Shek, renowned for his generalship for the republic, has made it known his intentions to become prime minister."

 china.24.t:0 "Leadership Elections for the Xinhai Republicans"
 china.24.d:0 "With the socially liberal Xinhai Republicans in power, they must now elect a prime minister. Sun Fo, current head of the party, has both the name and political clout to lead the nation, as the son of the nation’s founder. Popular Shanghai governor Yu Hung-chun has, however, made motions to try and take the prime ministership for himself. Yu’s reforms in the city have made him a popular choice among party members, though some are unsure if he has the legitimacy to match Sun."
 china.24.a:0 "Sun Fo continues his father's legacy"
 china.24.b:0 "O. K. Yui takes command from Shanghai"
 china.25.t:0 "The Jiang Manifesto"
 china.25.d:0 "Women’s Suffrage has been slow to arrive in China as a concept. Though some small women’s clubs exist, they aren’t nearly as widespread as they are in the West. Among the most vocal proponents of the movement has been actress Jiang Qing. Qing has come to our government recently with her so-called “Jiang Manifesto” along with other members of the movement. They have asked that we endorse their manifesto, which calls for increased rights for women in regards to sexual freedom, divorce and working rights. Some believe that endorsing the movement could pave the way for women in the workplace, and even in the government."
 china.25.a:0 "Women's suffrage? What nonsense."
 china.25.b:0 "Make some token reforms"
 china.25.c:0 "This movement deserves support!"
 china.26.t:0 "The Nanjing Film Festival"
 china.26.d:0 "Chinese film has been steadily evolving as a medium since film first arrived in the nation. This evening, the evolution of Chinese film continued with the opening of the Nanjing Film Festival. Bringing together the finest minds of Chinese and Asian cinema, the film festival has been hailed as a celebration of the Chinese culture. Among the expected government guests were such figures as the up and coming director Cai Chusheng, who premiered “The Southern Shore”, a dramatization of the Xinhai Revolution. Other films, such as the directoral debut of Ruan Lingyu, have drawn praise from international critics."
 china.26.a:0 "What wonderful festivities."
 china.27.t:0 "The Student Movement"
 china.27.d:0 "Throughout China, young men and women have come out in force to demonstrate for liberal reform and democracy. The so-called “Student Movement” has gained traction on campuses throughout the nation. Members of the movement, headed by academic Nie Yiuanzi, have approached our government for support. Yuanzi, a noted socialist, has described her agenda to push for a greater political consciousness among the Chinese youth."
 china.27.a:0 "A movement worth supporting!"
 china.27.b:0 "Not interested, terribly sorry."
 china.28.t:0 "Chiang addresses the Yuan"
 china.28.d:0 "Addressing the former Legislative Yuan, Field Marshall Chiang kai Shek announced the permanent dissolution of the Republican government and the establishment of a temporary military junta. This junta will subsequently act as a transitional government leading into a new Chinese system of governance. The move has been met with widespread disdain by the Progressives and Moderate Conservatives in the KMT, who have decried the new junta as a blatant power grab by Chiang and his military clique. Elements of the provisional government have already been sent throughout the nation to “pacify” any opposition."
 china.28.a:0 "Arrest the traitors!"
 china.29.t:0 "Maintaining the Army's Favour"
 china.29.d:0 "The Clique came to power via the military, and through the military they shall maintain it. Meeting with notable officers in Nanjing, the new military autocrat has pushed to maintain their support for the new regime. While this naturally requires a little bit of bribery, it’s all necessary to be able to push for reforms in the armed forces, and to ensure the military doesn’t turn against us if the worst occurs."
 china.29.a:0 "A price to be paid for stability and peace."
 china.30.t:0 "The Day of the Truncheon"
 china.30.d:0 "Under the orders of Field Marshall Chiang, the armed forces have stormed the streets to restore order throughout the nation. In Beijing, Lisan and the CPC have fled underground as elements of the army have begun arresting and extrajudicially executing their members. Most notably, party upstart Mao Zedong is reportedly dead, having been shot trying to resist arrest. In the south, Liao Zhongkai and the progressive KMT have fled into neutral Indochina and abroad, seeking refuge from Chiang’s mad, bloody power grab. Notably missing is Sun Fo, head of the Xinhai Republicans, who has reportedly gone underground to foster some new resistance movement..."
 china.30.a:0 "We'll catch them soon enough."
 china.31.t:0 "The New Constitutional Convention"
 china.31.d:0 "In Nanjing, Chiang kai Shek and his cohorts have assembled alongside elements of the underground Chinese reactionary movements. Chiang and his authoritarian KMT loyalists claim their intention to establish a formal military junta. Others believe that Chiang has larger ambitions beyond just being a military dictator. Among the most notable attendees were the Qing loyalists and the Blueshirts. The Blueshirts, headed by Wang Jingwei, have remained on the sidelines of Republican politics since their inception. Jingwei fashions himself a champion of the Han Chinese peoples, and has promoted a doctrine of eugenics and racial superiority. The most shocking appearance is that of the Qing loyalists, who have made apparent their intention to restore exiled claimant emperor Pu Yi to the throne..."
 china.31.a:0 "Chiang is declared President for Life."
 china.31.b:0 "Chiang proclaims himself Emperor of China."
 china.31.c:0 "Wang Jingwei and the Blueshirts assume power."
 china.31.e:0 "The Xuantong Emperor reclaims his rightful throne."
 china.32.t:0 "Wang Jingwei and the Blueshirts Assume Power"
 china.32.d:0 "Having come out the victors in Chiang’s constitutional convention, Wang Jingwei and the Blueshirts have assumed control of the former Chinese Republic. Via the radio, Jingwei announced the creation of a new “Chinese Social Republic.” Throughout the nation, Blueshirt “Pacification” squads have begun to roll out in force to arrest or execute anyone who might oppose the new regime. The Republicans have quietly vowed themselves to resistance, while Li Lisan and the communists have already begun to mobilize in the North. Despite the best attempts of the new ruling party, it seems the damage may already be done to China…"
 china.32.a:0 "A Greater China is dawning..."
 china.33.t:0 "Chiang Declares himself Emperor of China"
 china.33.d:0 "In a lavish ceremony in Nanjing, Chiang kai Shek formally declared himself as Emperor Chiang I of the new Chinese Empire. Backed by his military cabal and the force of violence, Chiang I has announced the creation of a new Chinese Empire to celebrate the occasion. Predictably, the move has garnered a mix of mockery and disgust from both the communists and the former Republicans, who have increasingly mobilized themselves against Chiang’s new regime…"
 china.33.a:0 "Long live the new Imperial dynasty!"
 china.34.t:0 "Chiang consolidates the new Regime"
 china.34.d:0 "Chiang has further consolidated the new military regime, officially signing into law his role as autocrat of China. As the new Prime Minister for Life of China, Chiang has ordered yet another round of violence against his opponents. The roundup has been mildly successful, capturing some minor figures in the CPC and the former Republican government. Chiang has additionally proclaimed himself as “Lord Protector”, seemingly seeing himself as a Chinese Oliver Cromwell. How the Lord Protector will handle the growing unrest remains to be seen…"
 china.34.a:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures..."
 china.35.t:0 "Pu Yi is restored to the throne of China"
 china.35.d:0 "Arriving via plane in Nanjing, Emperor-apparent Pu Yi delivered his first address to the Chinese people since he fled the nation in the midst of the revolution that birthed it. He called for “greater calm” among the Chinese people, and stated his confidence that the resumption of the absolutist monarchy will help bring peace and stability to the “Restored Qing Empire.” Already, the communists have mobilized in the North, while the Republicans in and around Nanjing have begun to whisper of a Second Xinhai Revolution…"
 china.35.a:0 "The Mandate of Heaven returns to China!"
 china.36.t:0 "Jingwei's First Suppression Campaign"
 china.36.d:0 "Blueshirt “Pacification Squads” stormed through the streets of many Chinese cities today. Armed and backed by the Chinese army, the Pacification Squads seized control of dozens of newspapers and radio stations. Claiming that these media organizations were harboring “Anti-State sympathies”, most of the buildings housing these institutions were burned and their workers either arrested or shot on the spot. While the violence was most intense in the coastal industrial cities, reports have also been made of widespread racially motivated violence in the autonomous regions of the interior."
 china.36.a:0 "The only real power comes out the barrel of a gun."
 china.37.t:0 "China for the Chinese"
 china.37.d:0 "Blueshirt Pacification Squads are on the move through China. Armed to the teeth, the Pacification Squads have begun moving through major cities, systematically rounding up Chinese citizens. Over the course of one night alone, thousands have been arrested and shipped off to so-called “Ethnic Resettlement Centers” in the Chinese countryside. The vast majority of those arrested have been non-Han Chinese, homosexuals, intellectuals and leftists, individuals decried by the Jingwei regime as working against the new “China for the Chinese” mandate. The violence and arrests continue to spread from Nanjing out into the countryside, as hundreds more are shipped out to Resettlement Centers, which are typically little more than fenced off sections of open fields..."
 china.37.a:0 "A Pure China is a strong China!"
 china.38.t:0 "Lisan declares the people's revolution!"
 china.38.d:0 "The so-called “People’s Liberation Army” is on the move. Li Lisan, backed by the force of communist militias and left-leaning army leaders, has announced his opposition to the Nanjing government. Calling the Republic a dead nation, Lisan proclaimed the revolution for a new “Chinese Soviet Republic” to bring law and order back to the broken nation. "
 china.38.a:0 "This shall not stand!"
 china.38.b:0 "Onwards, comrades! (PLAY AS PRC)"
 china.39.t:0 "Sun Fo declares the Second Xinhai Revolution"
 china.39.d:0 "The son of the Nation’s father, Sun Fo, has announced his opposition to the Nanjing government. Backed by pro-republican, Sun’s new “Second Republic of China” has risen up against our government. Elements of their new Republican army have already seized the capital, forcing the loyalists back to the emergency capital of Chongqing."
 china.39.a:0 "This shall not stand!"
 china.39.b:0 "Forwards, to victory! (PLAY AS SROC)"
 china.40.t:0 "Banning the CPC"
 china.40.d:0 "Predictably, the victorious Loyalist government has elected to officially ban the CPC, as well as any other parties associated with them. The outcry from the Moderate Socialists has been minimal at best, with most having fled the nation when a Loyalist victory became all but assured. Those lefists that have remained have either been forced into exile or been outright executed for treason, depending on their assocations with Lisan’s aborted revolution."
 china.40.a:0 "Well, maybe don't start civil wars then."
 china.41.t:0 "The CPC is Re-Integrated"
 china.41.d:0 "Though Lisan’s People’s Liberation Army has been defeated, many leftists have stated their willingness to join back with the Loyalist government. Though this naturally has been met with great criticism from those affected by the war, it would nonetheless help to mitigate the threat of a second communist uprising if the remaining leftists were re-integrated into new parties and the leftist KMT."
 china.41.a:0 "Malice towards none."
 china.42.t:0 "The Suppression of the Ma Muslims"
 china.42.d:0 "The Ma Clique has been defeated, and the three families have been dealt with accordingly for their treason against China. The Muslim minority in that region, whose differences with the Republican government lead to their secession in the first place, poses a potential threat to the new ruling government. Due to this, we have opted to actively suppress Muslim activities in the region. The beleaguered populace will likely do little to oppose the action, however if they do, containing insurrection should be relatively easy."
 china.42.a:0 "Unfortunate, but necessary."
 china.43.t:0 "The Ma Compromise"
 china.43.d:0 "Having defeated the Ma Clique, we must now turn our attentions to the Three Families and the Muslim minority in the region. Actively suppressing them would be a waste of valuable resources, and thus we have reached a compromise. The Three Families will be allowed to nominally govern the region, while remaining loyal to the government in Nanjing. The compromise, though disliked by hardliners, will nonetheless free up resources for elsewhere."
 china.43.a:0 "Cooperation for a better tomorrow."
 china.44.t:0 "The Abolition of the Tibetan Parliament"
 china.44.d:0 "Tibet is now fully within our grasp. The Dalai Lama, along with many Tibetans, have fled across the border into India and beyond. They can be dealt with in time. The issue remains, however, of the status of the Tibetan parliament. Though technically a monarchy under the Dalai Lama, a Tibetan parliament has existed since the nation broke free decades ago. We have thus seen fit to totally abolish the parliament, thus ensuring any resistance to the re-integration of Tibet is minimal at best."
 china.44.a:0 "That's the price of opportunism."
 china.45.t:0 "Approaching the Tibetan Parliament"
 china.45.d:0 "With Tibet having been re-annexed, we can turn towards how to re-integrate the nation into China. Our diplomats have approached the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Parliament with a compromise. Tibet will remain nominally independent, but must recognize the government in Nanjing as their overlord. Through this, the Tibetan people will be able to maintain their culture and identity, while also being part of something greater than just a Tibetan state."
 china.45.a:0 "Cooperation is key."
 china.46.t:0 "The Confederation Proposal"
 china.46.d:0 "With China reunified under the loyalist government, several advisors have come forward with an interesting proposal. Due to our handling of the Ma Muslims and the Tibetans, many of the ethnically diverse regions of China have proven more willing to work under Nanjing’s mandate. What has been proposed is to capitalize on this trust and create a confederation of semi-autonomous states. Unlike the previous autonomous regions that birthed the regionalism threat, this new state would be organized around Nanjing while affording each ethnic region their own legislative body and autonomy."
 china.46.a:0 "An excellent idea!"
 china.46.b:0 "Maybe not right now..."
 china.47.t:0 "The Beijng General Strike"
 china.47.d:0 "In response to the massive economic crisis, the CPC has cooperated with the Labour Unions to launch a general strike in the greater Beijing area. With much of our industry concentrated there, the strike has ground industry to an absolute halt. In a move to promote solidarity throughout the nation, similar general strikes are being planned in Nanjing and Chongqing. We should be careful in how we handle this particular strike, as agitating the communists with a forceful response might lead to serious problems."
 china.47.a:0 "Those damnable reds."
 CHI_Beijing_Strike.tt:0 "£decision_icon_small §R We must make a decision on how to handle the strike. .§!\n"
 china.48.t:0 "The Strike spreads nationwide"
 china.48.d:0 "With the Beijing General Strike having gone on without interruption or intervention, the organizers have been emboldened to spread their strike nationwide. In major cities throughout China, workers have organized mass walkouts and have assembled in the streets, demanding change to government policy. We need to take some kind of action to counteract the growing anger, even if it means coming to the table with the Reds."
 china.48.a:0 "Let them shout."
 china.49.t:0 "Meeting with the Strikers"
 china.49.d:0 "Having few other options, we’ve opted to meet with the strikers to come to some sort of arrangement. The Reds are unified in their demands, which have been outlined to us in a lengthy manifesto. Among their requests are demands for an eight hour workday, as well as better pay for industrial and agricultural workers. Their demands would put considerable strain on our already exhausted resources, but agreeing to them for now might help ease tensions."
 china.49.a:0 "Agree to their requests"
 china.49.b:0 "Stall on the negotiations"
 china.49.c:0 "Have them arrested at the meeting"
 china.50.t:0 "The Beijing Labour Agreements"
 china.50.d:0 "We have fully agreed to the striker’s demands. Industry is slowly crawling back to life across the Chinese nation as tensions begin to ease. The Reds have gotten their reforms, and we have gotten the country back under our control. The Beijing Labour Agreements, though they will cause trouble with our industrialization, will nonetheless pave the way for better cooperation with the Left in China. We’ve been forced to compromise, but it seems that China has escaped a major catastrophe with the signing of these accords."
 china.50.a:0 "Unfortunate, but needed reform."
 china.51.t:0 "The Red negotiators walk."
 china.51.d:0 "The delegation sent by the Strikers and the Leftists has walked from the negotiations. The strike will continue unabated, and Lisan has vowed that the failure of the government to address the looming crisis will cost them “dearly”."
 china.51.a:0 "This is bad."
 china.52.t:0 "The Strikers' Leadership is captured"
 china.52.d:0 "Using the negotiations as a ploy, elements of the army and local police have successfully apprehended the Strike leadership. With their leadership captured, we’ve been able to force those involved to call off the strike and return to business as usual. Elements of our own government may decry the move as undemocratic, but such things must be done to protect the stability of China. With the strike ended with relatively little bloodshed, it seems we have averted a major catastrophe for China."
 china.52.a:0 "Excellent."
 china.53.t:0 "The Strikers' Leadership escapes"
 china.53.d:0 "Using the negotiations as a ploy, elements of the army and police attempted to apprehend the Strike leadership while leaving the first round of negotiations. In the ensuing chaos, several members of the Strike leadership were shot and killed, including CPC party upstart Mao Zedong. Those that were not captured have fled the capital for their leftist holdouts in Beijing. Lisan has since vowed revenge against the Chinese government via a pirate radio speech. It seems we have made a terrible error."
 china.53.a:0 "Damnit!"
 china.54.t:0 "The Beijing Massacre"
 china.54.d:0 "Troops from the Republican government, deployed to the Beijing area to try and break the strike, have opened fire on protestors. The incident, now being decried as the Beijing Massacre, occurred when protestors overwhelmed a group of soldiers attempting to prevent their gathering. In the chaos, one of the protestors supposedly threw a rock at one of the soldiers, prompting a volley of rifle fire. Similar massacres throughout the city have also been reported as militant leftist and communist forces begin mobilizing to protect the strikers. Our forces have already been forced to retreat from the Beijing area due to intense leftist partisan attacks."
 china.54.a:0 "Oh."
 china.55.t:0 "Lisan declares the People's Revolution"
 china.55.d:0 "Citing our handling of the general strike, Li Lisan and the CPC have banded together with other leftist groups in the North around Beijing. He claims the Nanjing government has been unable to handle the economic crisis, and that they have repeatedly shot down attempts at reform, literally or otherwise. Announcing the formation of a “People’s Liberation Army”, Lisan has stated his intention to usurp power from the Bourgeoisie oppressors and establish a new worker’s republic."
 china.55.a:0 "Bring down these traitors!"
 china.55.b:0 "Arise, comrades! (PLAY AS PRC)"
 china.56.t:0 "The China Rifle"
 china.56.d:0 "Chinese weapon designs have been underwhelming at best. With very few national weapons manufacturers in the nation, we’ve been forced to look elsewhere for rifle designs to emulate. Our advisors have come up with three potential rifle designs to emulate. Those of the rifles employed by the Free German Army in Westphalia, the Royal Army of Britain, and the Imperial French Army. Each rifle design will provide certain drawbacks, but will also provide certain benefits to our forces."
 china.56.a:0 "Emulate German Rifle Designs"
 china.56.b:0 "Emulate British Rifle Designs"
 china.56.c:0 "Emulate Russian Rifle Designs"

 ChinaExternal.1.t:0 "China seeks investments"
 ChinaExternal.1.d:0 "With the recent economic downturn in China, the government of the Republic has approached us seeking investments. Through the Imperial Investment Corporation, we can pump money into infrastructure and public programs throughout China with a fairly significant return. Additionally, our investment in the region could help to edge in to what was previously a French dominated market."
 ChinaExternal.1.a:0 "Anythig to edge the French out of the East"
 ChinaExternal.1.b:0 "We're not interested right now."
 ChinaExternal.2.t:0 "London accepts our proposal"

 ChinaExternal.3.d:0 "Britain has rejected our proposal. We must look elsewhere."
 ChinaExternal.3.a:0 "That's unfortunate"
 ChinaExternal.4.t:0 "China seeks investments"
 ChinaExternal.4.d:0 "The Middle Kingdom is often seen as little more than a glorified French dominion in many circles of the Empire. Our opium exports have made them soft and, despite frequent protests from the ROC and the former Qing, continue through Hong Kong. Surprisingly, today, the Chinese have approached us looking for investors in their wrecked economy. Our own economy is in a similar state since the Stock Crisis, and we would do well to expand our economic influence in the region and edge the British out."
 ChinaExternal.4.a:0 "A perfect chance to expand in the region"
 ChinaExternal.4.b:0 "We're fine as is, thanks."
 ChinaExternal.5.t:0 "France accepts our proposal"

 ChinaExternal.6.a:0 "That's unfortunate."
 ChinaExternal.7.t:0 "China seeks investments"
 ChinaExternal.7.d:0 "In light of the recent economic crisis in Europe, Chinese officials have come to us seeking investments. The Mantetsu railway companies have approached us, and are willing to help build Chinese infrastructure. Some in the government are less than thrilled with what is seen as glorified collaboration with the enemy, but we would be remiss if this wasn’t an opportunity to gain an upper hand in the Eastern markets."
 ChinaExternal.7.a:0 "An excellent idea."
 ChinaExternal.7.b:0 "Not interested."
 ChinaExternal.8.t:0 "Japan accepts our proposal"

 ChinaExternal.10.d:0 "China is in the midst of both a civil war and an ongoing famine, and has petitioned the Hague Committee for assistance. As the conflict threatens our interests in the region, particularly if one of the rebel groups succeeds in overthrowing the loyalists, many of our diplomats believe we are compelled to act in accordance with British interests in Asia."

 ChinaExternal.16.t:0 "China aligns towards London"
 ChinaExternal.16.d:0 "China has finally stabilized itself since the economic crisis. Having established a foreign ministry, they are now looking outwards for new alliances. Diplomats from Nanjing have made it apparent that they intend to align towards the United Kingdom and the Greater British Empire, though the extent of this alignment remains to be seen."
 ChinaExternal.16.a:0 "Let's see how this plays out."
 ChinaExternal.17.t:0 "China aligns towards Paris"
 ChinaExternal.17.d:0 "China has finally stabilized itself since the economic crisis. Having established a foreign ministry, they are now looking outwards for new alliances.

 ChinaExternal.18.t:0 "China requests to join the London Institute"
 ChinaExternal.18.d:0 "China has made a request for scientific advisors. Several research advisors have offered to be part of a diplomatic advisory mission to China, as a way to further cement our alignment to the nation. How should we proceed?"
 ChinaExternal.18.a:0 "An Excellent idea."

 ChinaExternal.20.a:0 "That's unfortunate."
 ChinaExternal.21.t:0 "China requests Royal Navy Advisors"
 ChinaExternal.21.d:0 "The Chinese government has requested for advisors from the Royal Navy to come to Nanjing to assist in the development of the Chinese Navy. The Chinese Navy is underwhelming at best, so perhaps assisting them would allow us to more easily project the power of the Royal Navy to the Pacific and, most importantly, as a bulwark against Japanese expansionism."
 ChinaExternal.21.a:0 "Why not?"
 ChinaExternal.21.b:0 "We can't spare anything right now."

 ChinaExternal.23.d:0 "The United Kingdom has refused to our request for naval advisors."
 ChinaExternal.23.a:0 "Unfortunate"
 ChinaExternal.24.t:0 "Negotiating the Return of Hong Kong"
 ChinaExternal.24.d:0 "Hong Kong was seized by the French during the Opium Wars, and since then it has been the dream of Chinese nationalists to reclaim the port. The continued existence of French administrators on Chinese soil has been a point of tension between Paris and Nanjing for decades. Having aligned to the United Kingdom, we can now use their support to broker for the return of Hong Kong. We can approach this in several ways. Outright demanding the territory might provoke a violent French response. On the other hand, we could seek a compromise at the Hague Committee, establishing Hong Kong as an independent Committee mandate. We could also simply opt to drop all claims on the port and allow the French to control it permanently."
 ChinaExternal.24.a:0 "Demand Hong Kong be returned to China."
 ChinaExternal.24.b:0 "Offer a compromise."
 ChinaExternal.24.c:0 "Drop all claims on the port."
 ChinaExternal.25.t:0 "China demands the return of Hong Kong"
 ChinaExternal.25.d:0 "Backed by the British Empire, the Chinese government has demanded that the French Empire leave Hong Kong immediately and return the port to Chinese administration. The port has been in our possession for decades, and is a key gateway for the distribution of opium into Southern China. Abandoning the port would make it far more difficult to trade Opium in the region, as well as force us to use other ports to project power. Not only that, it would make France look weak on the world stage. On the other hand, trying to hold the port against a Chinese invasion would be absurd right now."
 ChinaExternal.25.a:0 "Fine. Abandon the Port."
 ChinaExternal.25.b:0 "What nerve! Absolutely not!"
 ChinaExternal.26.t:0 "France abandons Hong Kong"
 ChinaExternal.26.d:0 "France has agreed to abandon Hong Kong, and will turn over all administration of the port to the Nanjing government. Hong Kong is back in Chinese hands for the first time in more than a century."
 ChinaExternal.26.a:0 "Yes!"
 ChinaExternal.27.t:0 "France refuses to cede Hong Kong"
 ChinaExternal.27.d:0 "France has refused to cede Hong Kong to us, despite support from the British."

 ChinaExternal.27.b:0 "Stand down."
 ChinaExternal.28.t:0 "Our forces successfully seize Hong Kong"
 ChinaExternal.28.d:0 "Our forces have successfully stormed Hong Kong and taken control of the ports. The French administrators of the port have either been apprehended or fled via boat. Now we can only wait to see how the French respond."
 ChinaExternal.28.a:0 "Let's see how this plays out."
 ChinaExternal.29.t:0 "Our forces fail to seize Hong Kong"
 ChinaExternal.29.d:0 "Our forces have failed to seize Hong Kong, and have been repelled by the French forces stationed there."
 ChinaExternal.29.a:0 "Uh, well. This is awkward."
 ChinaExternal.30.t:0 "China takes Hong Kong by force."
 ChinaExternal.30.d:0 "Chinese forces have overrun our garrison at Hong Kong and seized control of the city. French officers and administrators have fled to nearby Indochina while they await our response."
 ChinaExternal.30.a:0 "This empire wasn't born without a bit of nerve."
 ChinaExternal.30.b:0 "It's not worth the effort."
 ChinaExternal.31.t:0 "Chinese forces attempt to take Hong Kong"
 ChinaExternal.31.d:0 "Chinese forces launched an aborted offensive to seize Hong Kong. Though they’ve been driven off, we must decide how to proceed going forward."
 ChinaExternal.31.a:0 "We'll show them what for."
 ChinaExternal.31.b:0 "Well, that's rude."
 ChinaExternal.32.t:0 "The Hong Kong Compromise"
 ChinaExternal.32.d:0 "China has approached us, via both the British and the Hague Committee, with a proposal. Rather than outright demanding the return of Hong Kong, they have offered to set up the port as a joint mandate between France and China, with oversight from the Hague Committee. Through this, we would be able to maintain nominal control over the port, while allowing the Chinese to utilize it as well."
 ChinaExternal.32.a:0 "Sounds reasonable."
 ChinaExternal.32.b:0 "What? No."
 ChinaExternal.33.t:0 "France Agrees to the Compromise"
 ChinaExternal.33.d:0 "France has agreed to the compromise. Hong Kong will be established as an independent mandate, protected by the signatories of the treaty and allowing military access to both France and China through the port."
 ChinaExternal.33.a:0 "Truly a victory for diplomacy."
 ChinaExternal.34.t:0 "France refuses the Compromise"
 ChinaExternal.34.d:0 "France has refused to agree to the compromise."
 ChinaExternal.34.a:0 "That's unfortunate."
 ChinaExternal.35.t:0 "Nationwide Opium Crackdown"
 ChinaExternal.35.d:0 "With British backing, we’ve been able to institute a nationwide crackdown on the French opium trade in Southern China. Hundreds of thousands of pounds of French opium have been seized in just the last few days, and more is likely on the way. Coupled with a comprehensive rehabilitation programme, we should be able to rid ourselves of the opium crisis once and for all."
 ChinaExternal.35.a:0 "That'll show the French what for."
 ChinaExternal.36.t:0 "China cracks down on Opium Trade"
 ChinaExternal.36.d:0 "China, backed by the British, has taken on our opium trade in Southern China. An exponential amount of French produced opium has been seized by the Chinese government, severely cutting into our bottom line. Foreign adventurism in China would be extremely unpopular with the public, but would be a way of protecting our dividends from the Opium trade."
 ChinaExternal.36.a:0 "We'll make due."
 ChinaExternal.36.b:0 "How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, China?"
 ChinaExternal.37.t:0 "China in the Commonwealth"
 ChinaExternal.37.d:0 "China has proven themselves a worthy potential ally. Having faced down the French and stood alongside us, we can now fully bring them into the fold of the Commonwealth of Nations."
 ChinaExternal.37.a:0 "Of course!"
 ChinaExternal.37.b:0 "Not interested."
 ChinaExternal.38.t:0 "China seeks eased relations"
 ChinaExternal.38.d:0 "“The rivalry between China and Japan has existed for centuries. From the days of the Qing dynasty to today, China and Japan have faced each other down endless times. Only now, with the Great War, has it become obvious that we will destroy one another if we continue down this path.” The stirring speech from Chinese diplomats to our government today marks a major tonal change in Sino-Japanese relations, as China is now actively seeking a political detente with the Japanese Empire."
 ChinaExternal.38.a:0 "Something to be considered, perhaps."
 ChinaExternal.39.t:0 "China pushes for Mongolian Democracy"
 ChinaExternal.39.d:0 "The “provisional” military junta governing Mongolia has been in power since it achieved independence in the Russian Civil War. Since then, calls for democracy have been violently repressed. The times have changed, however. The Republic of China has begun to exert their influence over the Asian mainland, and this has included the promotion of democratic ideals. Such ideals run contrary to the junta, but public opinion is quickly swinging towards demands for free and open elections."
 ChinaExternal.39.a:0 "Allow for free elections"
 ChinaExternal.39.b:0 "Continue the Military Junta"
 ChinaExternal.40.t:0 "China condemns Japanese Imperialism"
 ChinaExternal.40.d:0 "In a scathing radio speech, the Legislative Yuan of the Chinese Republic has stated a universal condemnation of Japan and her Empire. Calling Japan an “evil empire”, the Yuan voted unanimously to officially condemn Japan and their attempts to Japanize their colonial holdings. Most notably, China condemned the refusal of the Japanese authorities to allow for home rule in these territories, and their active suppression of nationalist movements."
 ChinaExternal.40.a:0 "How rude."
 ChinaExternal.41.t:0 "China requests scientific advisors"
 ChinaExternal.41.d:0 "With China beginning to align towards the French Empire, the Chinese government has requested research advisors from the Imperial Science Committee. Several have already volunteered, and such a mission to China would help us continue to woo them over towards our side."
 ChinaExternal.41.a:0 "Of course."
 ChinaExternal.41.b:0 "No."
 ChinaExternal.42.t:0 "China seeks imperial loans"
 ChinaExternal.42.d:0 "China continues to lean towards the French Empire, and has requested loans to help improve their military industry. While the economic crisis has damaged our economy just as much as it has theirs, such loans could further promote positive Sino-French relations and improve the Chinese arms industry."
 ChinaExternal.42.a:0 "I think we can spare the money"
 ChinaExternal.42.b:0 "Not right now."
 ChinaExternal.43.t:0 "France agrees to provide loans"
 ChinaExternal.43.d:0 "France has agreed to supply us with Imperial loans to improve our arms industry."
 ChinaExternal.43.a:0 "Excellent"
 ChinaExternal.44.t:0 "France refuses to provide loans"
 ChinaExternal.44.d:0 "France has refused to supply us with Imperial loans to improve our arms industry."
 ChinaExternal.44.a:0 "Unfortunate"
 ChinaExternal.45.t:0 "China and the Opium Trade"
 ChinaExternal.45.d:0 "It’s not secret that our Opium trade in China has been a point of contention. Some even believe that our actions in the Opium Wars contributed to the fall of the Qing dynasty and the rise of the Republic. With China beginning to align towards us, they have requested a review of our policy on the opium trade. Optimally, they would like us to cease the trade entirely. Ceasing the trade would cause us to lose the profits earned from the Guangdong Opium trade, however we could request the Chinese government pay us back for them in exchange. Tit for tat, as they say."
 ChinaExternal.45.a:0 "Cease the trade, but request repayment for lost profit."
 ChinaExternal.45.b:0 "Cease the trade entirely."
 ChinaExternal.45.c:0 "Refuse to cease the trade"
 ChinaExternal.46.t:0 "France offers a counter-deal"
 ChinaExternal.46.d:0 "France has made a counter-offer. They will cease the opium trade through Guangdong, and in exchange we will provide repayment for lost profits."
 ChinaExternal.46.a:0 "Fair enough."
 ChinaExternal.46.b:0 "What? No."
 ChinaExternal.47.t:0 "France agrees to cease opium trade"
 ChinaExternal.47.d:0 "France has agreed to end their opium trade into China without incident."
 ChinaExternal.47.a:0 "That was easy."
 ChinaExternal.48.t:0 "France refuses to end the Opium trade"
 ChinaExternal.48.d:0 "France has refused to end the opium trade. We’ll have to make due until we can figure out some other plan."
 ChinaExternal.48.a:0 "Shit."
 ChinaExternal.49.t:0 "The Hong Kong Compromise"
 ChinaExternal.49.d:0 "The issue of Hong Kong and our presence in Southern China has been a constant point of contention with the Chinese. With their government aligning towards ours, the topic of the Hong Kong port has come up once more. Some of our advisors have proposed that the port be established as an independent mandate, allowing both nations access through it. Others think we should simply trade the port back to the Chinese in exchange for economic preference."
 ChinaExternal.49.a:0 "Reach a compromise"
 ChinaExternal.49.b:0 "Trade the port for a favorable deal"
 ChinaExternal.49.c:0 "Refuse outright."
 ChinaExternal.50.t:0 "The Hong Kong Compromise"
 ChinaExternal.50.d:0 "France has come back to us with a compromise. Rather than handing over the Hong Kong port outright, both our nations will agree to share the port as part of a Hague Committee mandate. This would allow both nations to utilize it for basing and trade."
 ChinaExternal.50.a:0 "A reasonable arrangement"
 ChinaExternal.50.b:0 "Absolutely not."
 ChinaExternal.51.t:0 "China agrees to the deal."
 ChinaExternal.51.d:0 "China has agreed to our arrangement."
 ChinaExternal.51.a:0 "Excellent."
 ChinaExternal.52.t:0 "China refuses the deal"
 ChinaExternal.52.d:0 "China has refused our arrangement."
 ChinaExternal.52.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 ChinaExternal.53.t:0 "France requests payment for the Port"
 ChinaExternal.53.d:0 "France has responded by stating that they will return the ports, but only in exchange for a favorable deal for the foreseeable future. "
 ChinaExternal.53.a:0 "Fine."
 ChinaExternal.53.b:0 "What? No."
 ChinaExternal.54.t:0 "China agrees to the deal."
 ChinaExternal.54.d:0 "China has agreed to our arrangement."
 ChinaExternal.54.a:0 "Good."
 ChinaExternal.55.t:0 "China refuses the deal."
 ChinaExternal.55.d:0 "China has refused our arrangement."
 ChinaExternal.55.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 ChinaExternal.56.t:0 "France refuses to cede the ports outright"
 ChinaExternal.56.d:0 "France has refused to cede Hong Kong to us outright. We will need to find alternative means of acquiring it."
 ChinaExternal.56.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 ChinaExternal.57.t:0 "China requests to join the Entente"
 ChinaExternal.57.d:0 "China has requested to formalize our arrangement and officially join the Imperial Entente."
 ChinaExternal.57.a:0 "Of course!"
 ChinaExternal.57.b:0 "No."

 # CHINA CIVIL WAR EVENTS
 #########################
 ChinaCivilWar.1.t:0 "Volunteers from the Internationale"
 ChinaCivilWar.1.d:0 "As the war begins, volunteers from the Internationale have arrived in Beijing to assist in the worker’s revolution. Divisions form as far as the USASR and Bavaria have pledged themselves to our cause, and are ready to be deployed on the front lines."
 ChinaCivilWar.1.a:0 "To arms, comrades!"
 ChinaCivilWar.2.t:0 "General Zoulin declares Manchurian Independence"
 ChinaCivilWar.2.d:0 "From an improvised capital in Manchuria, General Zhang Zoulin announced an independent Manchurian state. Though little more than a thinly disguised military junta, the move has been met with widespread public support in the face of the growing peril of the Civil War. Zhang’s suspected sympathies with Japan are a source of concern, however, as some fear that he may choose to align with China’s rival in exchange for protection from the Civil War’s victors."
 ChinaCivilWar.2.a:0 "Coward."
 ChinaCivilWar.3.t:0 "Seizing Xikang?"
 ChinaCivilWar.3.d:0 "With China in disarray, we now have an opportunity to take back our historic lands in Xikang. The move should be relatively bloodless, as the Chinese will be too distracted with their own concerns to try and strike at us. Or, at least, we assume they will be. How should we proceed?"
 ChinaCivilWar.3.a:0 "We can't risk it right now."
 ChinaCivilWar.3.b:0 "Let's do it!"
 ChinaCivilWar.4.t:0 "Tibet seizes Xikang"
 ChinaCivilWar.4.d:0 "Tibetan militias have seized control of Xikang, a territory that the Tibetan nation have laid claim to since their aborted attempt at independence during the time of Yuan Shikai. Now, in our darkest hour, they have seen fit to take back that which is not theirs."
 ChinaCivilWar.4.a:0 "We'll handle them later."
 ChinaCivilWar.4.b:0 "Civil war be damned. This shall not stand!"
 ChinaCivilWar.5.t:0 "The Yunnan Clique declares independence"
 ChinaCivilWar.5.d:0 "Just this morning, former Chinese officers in the Yunnan province announced their independence from the Republic of China. Long Yun, the head of the so-called “Yunnan Clique”, stated in a radio address that the move was intended to protect Chinese citizens in Yunnan. Some of our more cynically minded officers believe this to be a blatant power grab by cowardly officers. Nonetheless, we can’t afford to deal with them right now."
 ChinaCivilWar.5.a:0 "Traitors!"
 ChinaCivilWar.6.t:0 "Ma Clique declares independence"
 ChinaCivilWar.6.d:0 "The predominantly Muslim regions in the Chinese interior have long been a source of frustration to the government. This has now culminated in them declaring independence in the face of the Civil War. The clique’s de-facto leader, Ma Bufang, announced the creation of an independent Ma state, and that the Republic of China was a dead nation. "
 ChinaCivilWar.6.a:0 "They'll pay soon enough"
 ChinaCivilWar.7.t:0 "The Mongolian Border Regions break free"
 ChinaCivilWar.7.d:0 "The Mongolian minority on the border have always been a threat, but now that threat has become very real. Prince De, a Mongolian prince in the region, has announced that the Mongolian Border Region is an independent state from China. He has also stated his intent for unification with Mongolia proper, calling for a “Greater Mongolian State.” The Republic has totally fallen apart, for now, and we must focus on maintaining what we have."
 ChinaCivilWar.7.a:0 "Japanese collaborators! All of them!"
 ChinaCivilWar.8.t:0 "Field Marshal Yuming Defects to the Republicans"
 ChinaCivilWar.8.d:0 "Field Marshal Du Yuming has defected to the Republicans! In the midst of the chaos throughout the remaining loyalist territories, the Field Marshall has fled across into the Republican territory, taking several divisions with him. This will do little more than weaken us, while strengthening the misguided Republican uprising."
 ChinaCivilWar.8.a:0 "How dare he!"
 ChinaCivilWar.9.t:0 "Field Marshal Yuming defects to us!"
 ChinaCivilWar.9.d:0 "Field Marshal Du Yuming has defected to us, bringing along with him several divisions of disorganized soldiers. Yuming, stating that he can no longer abide the excesses of the Chongqing government, has pledged his assistance to the our new government. His men can be integrated into the new Republican army post-haste."
 ChinaCivilWar.9.a:0 "We'll need all the help we can get."
 ChinaCivilWar.10.t:0 "Assassination attempt on Chiang!"
 ChinaCivilWar.10.d:0 "In the midst of a fiery speech decrying the uprising against the loyalist government, Communist revolutionary Lin Bao opened fire from the crowd. Bao, a minor leader within the party, was killed in the chaos. Chiang has been rushed to a nearby hospital, with doctors working frantically under armed guard to try and rescue the nation’s leader. A rash of mob violence has already broken out through the loyalist territories, with many left-leaning loyalists being killed or fleeing. It remains to be seen if Chiang will survive his injuries or not."
 ChinaCivilWar.10.a:0 "Chiang pulls through."
 ChinaCivilWar.10.b:0 "Chiang dies. Chaos ensues."
 ChinaCivilWar.11.t:0 "Chiang is Dead"
 ChinaCivilWar.11.d:0 "Chiang was unable to pull through, and died of his injuries. With the Loyalist’s leadership decapitated, power hungry elements are already on the move to take over the ailing Chinese government. We must act quickly and establish a new head of state before the Loyalist forces fall."
 ChinaCivilWar.11.a:0 "Madame Chiang assumes the Crown as Empress."
 ChinaCivilWar.11.b:0 "Madame Chiang takes over the junta."
 ChinaCivilWar.11.c:0 "Yan Xishan takes over the junta."
 ChinaCivilWar.12.t:0 "Firefight at the Xinjiang Border"
 ChinaCivilWar.12.d:0 "In the midst of the chaos in the former Republic, a shootout has occurred at our border with the Xinjiang separatist region. Their provisional government has been silent on the issue, though many in our newly formed military think we should retaliate immediately with strikes on their border as well. Such a foolhardy action would undoubtedly cause a response, and we may not be in a position to fight an open conflict right now."
 ChinaCivilWar.12.a:0 "Retaliate at once!"
 ChinaCivilWar.12.b:0 "Honest mistake. Let it slide."
 ChinaCivilWar.13.t:0 "Shootout at the Ma Clique Border"
 ChinaCivilWar.13.d:0 "Fighting has erupted at our border with the newly formed Ma Clique. After a misunderstanding at the border lead to an open shootout, it seems the Ma government has chosen to openly attack us in retaliation. The border raids have already lead to a dozen deaths between both sides. Ignoring such a provocation would make our government look weak."
 ChinaCivilWar.13.a:0 "They'll pay the price for this."
 ChinaCivilWar.13.b:0 "We can't afford a war right now."
 ChinaCivilWar.14.t:0 "Refugees from China"
 ChinaCivilWar.14.d:0 "As the fighting intensifies in China, a steady stream of refugees have come across the border via the Yunnan Clique. There are fears within the colonial government that many of the refugees may harbor sympathies with the People’s Liberation Army, and may serve to further ferment the issue of local native nationalism. It has been suggested that we seal the border crossings and begin patrolling, while also sending back the refugees into China. With the ongoing purges and violence, such an action may prove a death sentence for thousands, and a black mark against the East Indian regime."
 ChinaCivilWar.14.a:0 "Close the Border and Send them back."
 ChinaCivilWar.14.b:0 "We'll help where we can."
 ChinaCivilWar.15.t:0 "The Chinese Civil War encroaches on Hong Kong"
 ChinaCivilWar.15.d:0 "The conflict in China has begun to encroach on our treaty ports in the South. Though the belligerent factions have yet to try and seize Hong Kong, reports have come in that thousands of refugees have spilled into the port city seeking asylum. With the conflict intensifying, Jules Brévié, Governor General of French Indochina and overseer of our treaty ports, has requested permission to evacuate French diplomats and nationals to the nearby colony in Australie. Administration of Hong Kong and Guangzhouwan would be turned over, at least temporarily, to local Chinese loyalists for the duration of the war."
 ChinaCivilWar.15.a:0 "Evacuate French nationals and officials to Australie"
 ChinaCivilWar.15.b:0 "Maintain the Status Quo"
 ChinaCivilWar.16.t:0 "Loyalist Massacres"
 ChinaCivilWar.16.d:0 "In the midst of the chaos of the Civil War, we’ve been unable to control our heated forces in some regions. Reports have come in of a minor village of no particular political alignment being attacked and savaged by loyalist forces. This will deal a blow to our public support."
 ChinaCivilWar.16.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 ChinaCivilWar.17.t:0 "Communist Massacres"
 ChinaCivilWar.17.d:0 "In the midst of the chaos of the Civil War, we’ve been unable to control our heated forces in some regions. Reports have come in of a minor village of no particular political alignment being attacked and savaged by PLA forces. This will deal a blow to our public support."
 ChinaCivilWar.17.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 ChinaCivilWar.18.t:0 "Republican Massacres"
 ChinaCivilWar.18.d:0 "In the midst of the chaos of the Civil War, we’ve been unable to control our heated forces in some regions. Reports have come in of a minor village of no particular political alignment being attacked and savaged by Republican forces. This will deal a blow to our public support."
 ChinaCivilWar.18.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 ChinaCivilWar.19.t:0 "The Fall of Chongqing"
 ChinaCivilWar.19.d:0 "The Loyalist government’s emergency capital in Chongqing has fallen. Heavy fighting has damaged the city, and the fires still rage in many sectors. Intense fighting in the now abandoned government sector has left both our own men and the locals beleaguered. Not all the tidings are bad, however, as we have managed to capture several members of the Loyalist government. They have been dealt with appropriately. The issue remains, however, of how we should handle the status of Chongqing itself."
 ChinaCivilWar.19.a:0 "Burn it to the ground."
 ChinaCivilWar.19.b:0 "Malice towards none. Leave the city be for now."
 ChinaCivilWar.19.c:0 "Use some of our excess resources to assist the civilians."
 ChinaCivilWar.20.t:0 "The Fall of Chongqing"
 ChinaCivilWar.20.d:0 "The Loyalist government’s emergency capital in Chongqing has fallen. Heavy fighting has damaged the city, and the fires still rage in many sectors.

 ChinaCivilWar.21.t:0 "The Fall of Beijing"
 ChinaCivilWar.21.d:0 "Beijing is in flames as Loyalist forces reclaim the city. Despite intense fighting, which has left much of the city in ruins, our forces have regained control of the Communist stronghold. Those of Lisan’s former politburo that remained have been dealt with, and extrajudicial executions of former PLA officers are extremely commonplace. As we secure our occupation of the city, we must decide what our policy is to the civilians left behind by Lisan’s revolutionary ambitions."
 ChinaCivilWar.21.a:0 "Burn it to the ground."
 ChinaCivilWar.21.b:0 "Malice towards none. Leave the city be for now."
 ChinaCivilWar.21.c:0 "Use some of our excess resources to assist the civilians."

 ChinaCivilWar.23.t:0 "The Fall of Nanjing"
 ChinaCivilWar.23.d:0 "Nanjing has fallen and the Second Republic is likely soon to follow. With the city in ruins from intense fighting, we’ve had some difficulty gaining a foothold for our occupation. Elements of the former Yuan, abandoned by the Republicans, have been captured and dealt with appropriately. While the PLA moves to pacify the remainder of the city, our plan for occupation must be decided upon."
 ChinaCivilWar.23.a:0 "Burn it to the ground."

 ChinaCivilWar.24.c:0 "Use some of our excess resources to assist the civilians."
 ChinaCivilWar.25.t:0 "Major Failed Harvest"
 ChinaCivilWar.25.d:0 "With the ongoing war, rice harvests in the Loyalist territories have been a miserable failure this year. As much of the food stores are being used to bolster the war effort, the population has been dependent on our rice stockpiles for rationing. The failure of this year’s harvest is already being felt throughout the nationalist territories as starvation begins to creep into daily life. If we can’t get the situation under control soon, then we could be facing a major famine."
 ChinaCivilWar.25.a:0 "This is bad."
 ChinaCivilWar.26.t:0 "Failed Harvest escalates to Famine"
 ChinaCivilWar.26.d:0 "Our failure to take measures against the ongoing food shortages has come back around to bite us. While previously, we were simply running into supply issues on the frontline, now we’ve been forced to introduce full scale rationing in the Loyalist territories. Several of our remaining diplomats have suggested that we petition the Hague Committee for humanitarian aide. Though this would open us up to British or French meddling, it would at least mitigate the issue of the famine until we can revisit it. Failing to address the famine will seriously affect our ability to prosecute the conflict."
 ChinaCivilWar.26.a:0 "We should look to the international community for help."
 ChinaCivilWar.27.t:0 "Victory in the Civil War"
 ChinaCivilWar.27.d:0 "The rebellious elements of China have been pacified. Across what remains of the nation, cities burn and survivors bury their dead. The nation is in ruins, and our government has been severely destabilized. For now, we can celebrate having guided China through this time of trial, and can now direct our efforts at reconstructing the nation."

 ChinaCivilWar.28.t:0 "Victory in the Civil War"
 ChinaCivilWar.28.d:0 "The Revolution in China has succeeded. The People’s Liberation Army marches triumphantly through the streets of China, while General Secretary Lisan announced over the radio that hostilities had concluded. While our armies work to put down the last remnants of resistance, we must now turn our attentions on how to reconstruct the shattered Chinese nation. "
 ChinaCivilWar.28.a:0 "A victory, however phyrric, for the proletariat."
 ChinaCivilWar.29.t:0 "Victory in the Civil War"
 ChinaCivilWar.29.d:0 "The Authoritarians in both the Loyalists and the PLA have been toppled. Provisional Prime Minister of the Republic, Sun Fo, announced over the radio that hostilities had officially concluded. While Republican troops move to pacify the countryside, the Provisional government must now look to the future, and more specifically, rebuilding the nation that they had to destroy to save."
 ChinaCivilWar.29.a:0 "A victory for the free peoples of China"
 ChinaCivilWar.30.t:0 "A Deal with the Devil?"
 ChinaCivilWar.30.d:0 "The war has not been going in our favor. The rebellion has been able to sweep over and take control of several key regions, as well as driving us out of major cities. The possibility of defeat is very real. A team of diplomats have suggested that, given Japan’s ambitions in Asia, we could seek assistance from them. Such a deal would effectively destroy Chinese autonomy, but would allow us to draw in a Japanese intervention against the rebels. However, if we do this, we may incentivize the rebels to cooperate against both us and the Japanese. "
 ChinaCivilWar.30.a:0 "Make a deal with the Japanese"
 ChinaCivilWar.30.b:0 "We'll die with our dignity intact."
 ChinaCivilWar.31.t:0 "China looks for assistance"
 ChinaCivilWar.31.d:0 "With China in the midst of a massive Civil War, the Jingwei government has sought our assistance. Their ambassador has requested that the Japanese Empire intervene in the conflict, as allowing China to fall to communism or otherwise could cause havoc for regional stability. However, a full scale intervention in China would drag us into conflict with the forces involved."
 ChinaCivilWar.31.a:0 "Establish the Reorganized Chinese Republic"
 ChinaCivilWar.31.b:0 "We have no interest in China's affairs."
 ChinaCivilWar.32.t:0 "Japan Agrees to our Proposal"
 ChinaCivilWar.32.d:0 "Japan has agreed to our request. Forces from the Japanese Empire are en route to assist the Loyalist forces in crushing the rebellion."
 ChinaCivilWar.32.a:0 "Trading freedom for survival, it seems."
 ChinaCivilWar.33.t:0 "Japanese Interventionism in China"
 ChinaCivilWar.33.d:0 "Japan has intervened in favor of the Republicans. With a new Japanese puppet government in charge in Chongqing, the Loyalists now have all the resources of the Japanese Empire on their side. Our advisors have suggested that we form a pact with the democratic Republican faction to mutually resist the Japanese until the Loyalists can be dealt with."
 ChinaCivilWar.33.a:0 "Offer an armistice with the Republicans"
 ChinaCivilWar.33.b:0 "We'll handle things on our own."
 ChinaCivilWar.34.t:0 "The PLA proposes an armistice"
 ChinaCivilWar.34.d:0 "With the recent Japanese intervention in favor of the loyalists, the PLA leadership has proposed a ceasefire and an armistice to join forces and defeat the loyalists. Taking such a deal would temporarily end our hostilities with the Communists, and would unite our forces. With our resources pooled, we might be able to better combat the Loyalist-backed Japanese forces."
 ChinaCivilWar.34.a:0 "We're stronger together"
 ChinaCivilWar.34.b:0 "We don't cooperate with traitors."
 ChinaCivilWar.35.t:0 "The Republicans agree to an armistice"
 ChinaCivilWar.35.d:0 "The Republicans have agreed to an armistice. We can now officially form a United Front against the Loyalist-backed Japanese."
 ChinaCivilWar.35.a:0 "Excellent"
 ChinaCivilWar.36.t:0 "The Republicans refuse an armistice"
 ChinaCivilWar.36.d:0 "The Republicans have refused an armistice. We can not form a United Front against the Loyalist-backed Japanese."
 ChinaCivilWar.36.a:0 "Well. Shit."
 ChinaCivilWar.37.t:0 "Japan Intervenes in the Civil War"
 ChinaCivilWar.37.d:0 "Japan has intervened in the Civil War. Having attacked against China, we are now facing a much larger threat than just the rebel factions. It has been proposed that we turn our attentions from fighting other Chinese, and towards trying to curb Japan’s imperial ambitions. This so-called “United Front” would unite the disparate factions to defeat the Japanese Empire."
 ChinaCivilWar.37.a:0 "Seek an armistice with the PLA"
 ChinaCivilWar.37.b:0 "Seen an armistice with the rebels"
 ChinaCivilWar.37.c:0 "We'll look after our own."
 ChinaCivilWar.38.t:0 "China proposes an armistice"
 ChinaCivilWar.38.d:0 "With Japan intervening in China, the loyalists have suggested an alliance to fight off the Japanese attack. If we refuse their offer, we’ll have to fight off the Japanese and any United Front members alone."
 ChinaCivilWar.38.a:0 "Cooperate with the Loyalists"
 ChinaCivilWar.38.b:0 "Refuse cooperation with the Loyalists"
 ChinaCivilWar.39.t:0 "The PLA agrees to an alliance"
 ChinaCivilWar.39.d:0 "The People’s Liberation Army has received our message and agreed to a unilateral armistice. Diplomats from the rebel state have agreed to form a temporary united front against the Japanese. For now, we fight together."
 ChinaCivilWar.39.a:0 "Wonderful."
 ChinaCivilWar.40.t:0 "China proposes an armistice"
 ChinaCivilWar.40.d:0 "With Japan intervening in China, the loyalists have suggested an alliance to fight off the Japanese attack. If we refuse their offer, we’ll have to fight off the Japanese and any United Front members alone."
 ChinaCivilWar.40.a:0 "Cooperate with the Loyalists"
 ChinaCivilWar.41.t:0 "The Republicans agrees to an alliance"
 ChinaCivilWar.41.d:0 "The Republican leadership has received our message and agreed to a unilateral armistice. Diplomats from the rebel state have agreed to form a temporary united front against the Japanese. For now, we fight together."
 ChinaCivilWar.41.a:0 "Wonderful."
 ChinaCivilWar.42.t:0 "The Reorganized Chinese Government Falls"
 ChinaCivilWar.42.d:0 "The Loyalist government has fallen. Those in their leadership are either scattered, in rebel custody, or dead. Whatever direct line we had to intervention in China has been severed, and many believe we should simply abandon the Loyalists and return to business as usual. This course of action, while it would garner support, would also allow the communist rebels to do as they see fit if they win the war, and perhaps even turn their attentions towards Japan, heaven forbid."
 ChinaCivilWar.42.a:0 "Abandon the Loyalists to their fate."
 ChinaCivilWar.42.b:0 "Prosecute the war to the bitter end."
 ChinaCivilWar.43.t:0 "Japan pulls out of China"
 ChinaCivilWar.43.d:0 "The traitorous Chinese loyalists have been defeated, and their Japanese puppeteers have fled back to their homeland with their tails between their legs. Now that the traitors have been dealt with, we can turn our attentions to securing the rest of the mainland."
 ChinaCivilWar.43.a:0 "Let's finish this."
 ChinaCivilWar.44.t:0 "The Postwar Constitutional Convention"
 ChinaCivilWar.44.d:0 "To secure the stability and future of our government, we have convened a postwar constitutional convention in the capital to re-examine the government. This convention should act to fully stabilize the government and prevent an all-out dissolution of the new China."
 ChinaCivilWar.44.a:0 "Reaffirm the power of the state."
 ChinaCivilWar.44.b:0 "Ensure peace and democracy for the future."
 ChinaCivilWar.44.c:0 "Do away with the mistakes of the past."
 ChinaCivilWar.45.t:0 "Communist Partisans attack Arms Factory"
 ChinaCivilWar.45.d:0 "In a nighttime raid, communist partisans attacked one of our arms factories. Several workers were killed, and much of the machining equipment was damaged. The factory will be useless to us until we can repair it."
 ChinaCivilWar.45.a:0 "These Reds are a menace to us all."
 ChinaCivilWar.46.t:0 "Communist Partisans attack Industrial Complex"
 ChinaCivilWar.46.d:0 "In a nighttime raid, communist partisans attacked one of our industrial complexes. Several workers were killed, and much of the machining equipment was damaged. The factory will be useless to us until we can repair it."
 ChinaCivilWar.46.a:0 "These Reds are a menace to us all."
 ChinaCivilWar.47.t:0 "Communist Partisans attack railways"
 ChinaCivilWar.47.d:0 "During the night, communist partisans detonated explosives on a major railway line, rendering it unusable until it can be repaired. We will need to divert resources to aid the reconstruction."
 ChinaCivilWar.47.a:0 "These Reds are a menace to us all."
 ChinaCivilWar.48.t:0 "Lisan's Last Stand"
 ChinaCivilWar.48.d:0 "Lisan’s fortress in the interior has finally fallen. After pounding the fortress with artillery pieces, Chinese soldiers charged through their defenses and defeated the demoralized and starving communists. Though orders were given to arrest Lisan and the remaining members of the politburo, the would-be revolutionary was ultimately killed in a firefight with our officers. The Politburo, the de-facto leadership of the former PLA, has either been killed or arrested. The former are already being shipped off to stand trial for crimes against the nation. At last, it seems, the Chinese people can know some semblance of peace."
 ChinaCivilWar.48.a:0 "Real political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."
 ChinaCivilWar.49.t:0 "Truth and Reconciliation Trials"
 ChinaCivilWar.49.d:0 "Many of those that participated in the Civil War are in the custody of our government. There have been a myriad of tragedies, massacres, and terror attacks since the first days of the conflict. Those in our government believe that justice can only be served through a so-called Truth and Reconciliation commission. Elements of the former People’s Liberation Army are already on schedule to be put on trial and are likely to be executed for their crimes. Among those accused are Su Yu, a high ranking member of the Communist rebel army. "
 ChinaCivilWar.49.a:0 "Execute the traitors."
 ChinaCivilWar.50.t:0 "The Purge of the Reactionaries"
 ChinaCivilWar.50.d:0 "The defeat of the Loyalists has brought us great promise, but there is still work to be done. Hundreds of former Loyalist officers remain in our custody and must be dealt with. Among those captured were elements of the former Loyalist government, including members of the former Loyalist military. Li Zongren, one of the surviving Loyalist generals, caused quite a stir at his trial when he accused politburo representatives of “conducting show trials”. He has since been dealt with swiftly."
 ChinaCivilWar.50.a:0 "Thus is the price of fighting the proletariat."
 ChinaCivilWar.51.t:0 "The Nanjing Trials"
 ChinaCivilWar.51.d:0 "Chiang’s clique, who first came to power through the instability of the Great Slump, has been defeated. Though Chiang himself might not have retained power, his shadow nonetheless looms over the new China. Those associated with the former Beijing Clique have been dealt with appropriately. Chiang’s fate, along with the fates of most of his associates, remains and likely will remain unknown. In the end, all that can truly be done now is pick up the pieces and try to cobble the decimated Second Republic back together again."
 ChinaCivilWar.51.a:0 "A terrible price to pay for democracy"
 ChinaCivilWar.52.t:0 "The Guangdong Clique declares independence"
 ChinaCivilWar.52.d:0 "The country has come apart at the seams. We have been unable to stabilize the government to prevent the nation from falling into warlordism and anarchy. In the South, Li Zongren and a cadre of officers have seized control and declared the Guangdong Clique. It is likely that other warlord states are soon to follow as the country breaks down into absolute chaos."
 ChinaCivilWar.52.a:0 "Oh, no."
 ChinaCivilWar.53.t:0 "The Shanxi Clique declares independence"
 ChinaCivilWar.53.d:0 "As the Chinese nation continues to fall apart, more and more people are rallying around local warlords for protection. A provisional military junta has seized control over the greater Shanxi region, proclaiming the Shanxi Clique. The country is continuing to fall apart every day."
 ChinaCivilWar.53.a:0 "I mean, it can't get any worse."
 ChinaCivilWar.54.t:0 "The Sichuan Clique breaks away"
 ChinaCivilWar.54.d:0 "The country is spiraling out of control. Elements of the military have broken off to form the Sichuan clique in the South, announcing their intention to form a more stable government to protect the people."
 ChinaCivilWar.54.a:0 "Ok, well, I'm sure we'll be fine."
 ChinaCivilWar.55.t:0 "The Anhui Clique seizes control of China"
 ChinaCivilWar.55.d:0 "The last of the loyalist military has seized control. Under a decentralized military junta, our government has been forced out of power in Nanjing. The remnant of the Chinese loyalist government has fled to Taiwan, acting as a government in exile until we can reclaim the continent from the rebellious warlord states."
 ChinaCivilWar.55.a:0 "Oh, uh, well. Shit."
 ChinaCivilWar.56.t:0 "The Military Remnants seize control"
 ChinaCivilWar.56.d:0 "With the remnant government in disarray, a group of officers formerly stationed on Taiwan during the collapse have moved to seize control of the government. Those representing the remnant government have been removed from power in favor of a provisional military junta. Those that were not apprehended immediately have fled on towards Indonesia and Indochina. With mainland China in disarray and Taiwan under the control of the local military, any dream of maintaining a united China dies here, today."
 ChinaCivilWar.56.a:0 "Thus ends the Chinese dream"
 ChinaCivilWar.57.t:0 "China breaks down into Warlordism"
 ChinaCivilWar.57.d:0 "China has spiraled into its’ own demise. Having won the civil war, the ruling faction was unable or unwilling to stabilize their government and regain control of the nation. With military warlords seizing control of the entire continent, the ruling faction has been forced into exile on Taiwan. With their nation weakened, several members of the military have proposed that we send the fleet south to annex the small island, presumably without incident. "
 ChinaCivilWar.57.a:0 "Send the fleet to annex Taiwan"
 ChinaCivilWar.57.b:0 "The remnants are of no concern to us."
 ChinaCivilWar.58.t:0 "Imperial Japanese Fleet off the coast"
 ChinaCivilWar.58.d:0 "The Imperial Japanese Navy has arrived off the coast of Taiwan. Heavily armed and seemingly battle ready, the IJN has provided their demands. Submit and allow Japanese rule over Taiwan, or face military force. How shall we proceed?"
 ChinaCivilWar.58.a:0 "Submit to the Japanese"
 ChinaCivilWar.58.b:0 "Caution be damned! Open fire!"
 ChinaCivilWar.59.t:0 "Taiwan submits"
 ChinaCivilWar.59.d:0 "Taiwan has agreed to our demands. The tiny remnant nation shall be officially annexed into the greater Japanese Empire. "
 ChinaCivilWar.59.a:0 "Excellent."
 ChinaCivilWar.60.t:0 "Taiwan fires on the Imperial Navy!"
 ChinaCivilWar.60.d:0 "Taiwan has not only rejected our demands, but also opened fire on the Imperial Japanese Navy ported near Taipei. Thought the ships have taken minimal damage, this is nonetheless an act of war against us!"
 ChinaCivilWar.60.a:0 "Raze the island to the ground."
 ChinaCivilWar.61.t:0 "Seek Japanese Protection?"
 ChinaCivilWar.61.d:0 "Manchuria’s independence is shaky, but secure. While the rest of China is fighting itself, we need to look beyond our borders to seek protection from whoever wins. Japan is a natural ally, due to our border with their Korean protectorate. We should open talks with the Japanese to seek some form of protection or guarantee of independence from China."
 ChinaCivilWar.61.a:0 "Open talks with Tokyo"
 ChinaCivilWar.61.b:0 "We'll be fine on our own."
 ChinaCivilWar.62.t:0 "Manchuria seeks assurances"
 ChinaCivilWar.62.d:0 "China is in chaos, and out of the chaos, Zoulin’s military junta has taken control of Manchuria. Zoulin and his new government have requested our protection. Manchuria could be a vital bridgehead for further conquests of China. Not only that, but widening our border with Russia might make further seizures of Siberia much easier to launch. How shall we proceed?"
 ChinaCivilWar.62.a:0 "Make them an offer they can't refuse."
 ChinaCivilWar.62.b:0 "We have no interest in adventurism in China"
 ChinaCivilWar.63.t:0 "The Japanese Offer"
 ChinaCivilWar.63.d:0 "The Japanese have come back to us with an offer. We can become a protectorate of the Japanese Empire, which would afford us protection from aggression from Chinese reclamation efforts. Additionally, it would afford us access to the resources of the Japanese Empire to rapidly industrialize the traditionally agrarian Manchurian countryside."
 ChinaCivilWar.63.a:0 "Become a Japanese protectorate."
 ChinaCivilWar.63.b:0 "Join the Co-Prosperity Sphere."
 ChinaCivilWar.64.t:0 "Seize Hulunbuir?"
 ChinaCivilWar.64.d:0 "With China in chaos, Manchuria has broken away under the Generalship of Zhang Zoulin. One of the territories they control is Hulunbuir, an area populated my a minority of ethnic Mongolian peoples. As the Manchu army is disorganized at best, we could easily sweep in and seize the territory with little resistance. Probably."
 ChinaCivilWar.64.a:0 "Let's do it!"
 ChinaCivilWar.64.b:0 "We can't afford a conflict right now."
 ChinaCivilWar.65.t:0 "Mongolia seizes Hulunbuir"
 ChinaCivilWar.65.d:0 "Mongolian forces have moved in and seized the province of Hulunbuir, stating that they are “protecting the ethnic Mongol population” there. Our army is still disorganized, and may not be able to fight off a full Mongolian invasion if we attempt to resist. How shall we proceed?"
 ChinaCivilWar.65.a:0 "We'll deal with them later."
 ChinaCivilWar.65.b:0 "This shall not stand!"
 ChinaCivilWar.66.t:0 "Offer Annexation to the MABR"
 ChinaCivilWar.66.d:0 "With China in disarray, a group of Mongolian minority dominant regions have broken away, declaring themselves the Mongolian Autonomous Border Region. The provisional government of the border region may be willing to be annexed fully back into Mongolia proper."
 ChinaCivilWar.66.a:0 "Offer the deal."
 ChinaCivilWar.66.b:0 "Do Nothing"
 ChinaCivilWar.67.t:0 "Mongolia offers reunification"
 ChinaCivilWar.67.d:0 "Our independence from China is shaky at best, and it’s unlikely the Chinese won’t attempt to reclaim our territory. Mongolia has offered reunification, annexing the Autonomous Region back into Mongolia proper. This may offer us some semblance of protection from any attempts by China to reclaim our territory."
 ChinaCivilWar.67.a:0 "For a greater Mongolia!"
 ChinaCivilWar.67.b:0 "We'll stay independent."
 ChinaCivilWar.68.t:0 "The Qing Constitution"
 ChinaCivilWar.68.d:0 "Anti-Qing sentiment has been growing steadily since the Emperor was restored to power by Chiang’s Beijing Clique. Such ideas have become louder and louder since the end of the Civil War, with some even going so far as to blame the conflict itself on the Qing Restoration. This situation cannot be maintained, and will lead to further unrest if not handled. Absolutism is extremely unpopular, and only through a compromise can the monarchy be maintained. It is with this that the new Qing Constitution is being written. Penned by a coalition of republicans and restorationists, the constitution melds elements of European constitutional monarchies with Chinese absolutism, allowing the monarch to remain head of state while allowing the legislative Yuan to operate unimpeded. Once the constitution is ratified, China will effectively become a constitutional monarchy."
 ChinaCivilWar.68.a:0 "An Empire for the people."
 ChinaCivilWar.69.t:0 "The First Elections of the Chinese Empire"
 ChinaCivilWar.69.d:0 "With the Qing constitution firmly established, old political parties have emerged to begin vying for a majority in the Yuan. The Progressive KMT, though ousted by Chiang and damaged by his purges, nonetheless has made a major push to regain their political hegemony. At the same time, the Conservative KMT has made major strides in earning the favor of the population despite their associations with collaborationist crimes under the Chiang Regime."
 ChinaCivilWar.69.a:0 "The Conservative KMT Wins"
 ChinaCivilWar.69.b:0 "The Xinhai Republicans Win"
 ChinaCivilWar.69.c:0 "The Progressive KMT Wins"
