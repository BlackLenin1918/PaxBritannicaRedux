    PB_CHI_Extraterrorialities:0 "Extraterritorial Excesses"
    PB_CHI_Extraterrorialities_desc:0 "Since the Opium Wars and the Boxer Rebellion, China has found itself carved up into spheres of influence by the European powers. Thousands of foreigners are effectively above Chinese law, and foreign businesses are granted preferential trade treatment by corrupt provincial governors. With millions of Wen tied up in these extraterritorialities and the corruption associated with them, the Chinese economy is badly constricted."
    PB_CHI_Regionalism:0 "Rampant Regionalism"
    PB_CHI_Regionalism_desc:0 "Regionalism has become a rampant problem thoughout the Chinese Empire. What first began as a method of decentralized governance in the rebellious Western provinces has snowballed completely out of control. Now, vast territories of the Empire are ruled by military governors and local cliques like petty kings, only tacitly acknowledging the central government in Beijing. This makes it nearly impossible to raise a modern conscript army, and greatly reduces any organization such an army might have."
    PB_CHI_Agrarian_Economy:0 "Agrarian Economy"
    PB_CHI_Agrarian_Economy_desc:0 "Industrialization has been slow to arrive in the Middle Kingdom. While imported European methods for farming and mechanized production have found success in the populated coastlines, the vast majority of the country still depends on medieval and unreliable subsistence farming or artisan methods of production. This has made the Chinese economy woefully uncompetetive and stalled any attempts at modernizing."
    PB_CHI_Revolutionary_Fervor:0 "Revolutionary Fervor"
    PB_CHI_Revolutionary_Fervor_desc:0 "China is in a state of crisis. The moribund Qing government is wholly incapable of managing the nation. People are hungry, despotic regional governors extract taxes on a whim for lavish parties, and bandits terrorize the rural populace without a proper police force. Nationalist rebels in Mongolia and Xinjiang appear with an uneasy regularity, while riots and violence grip major cities. The touchpaper of revolution has been lit, and the Chinese Empire is poised to explode into chaos at the drop of a hat."
