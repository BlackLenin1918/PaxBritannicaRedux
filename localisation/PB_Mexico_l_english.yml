  PB_MEX_Vestigial_Empire_desc:0 "Mexico once spanned from the arid deserts of the Mojave to the sweltering jungles of Centroamerica, but that was a long time ago. A century of economic decline, political infighting and ethnic separatism have shredded the Mexican Empire down to a nub. Mexico has become the Sick Man of the Americas, with an economy in freefall and political radicalization growing day by day. The military-led sham democracy is proving increasingly incapable of controlling public unrest, and the danger of civil war seems more real every day."
