  PB_MEX_Vestigial_Empire:0 "Vestigial Empire"
  PB_MEX_Vestigial_Empire_desc:0 "Mexico once spanned from the arid deserts of the Mojave to the sweltering jungles of Centroamerica, but that was a long time ago. A century of economic decline, political infighting and ethnic separatism have shredded the Mexican Empire down to a nub. Mexico has become the Sick Man of the Americas, with an economy in freefall and political radicalization growing day by day. The military-led sham democracy is proving increasingly incapable of controlling public unrest, and the danger of civil war seems more real every day."
  PB_MEX_Suspended_Constitution:0 "Suspended Constitution"
  PB_MEX_Suspended_Constitution_desc:0 "The Mexican Constitution was suspended following the election of the socialist Popular Front in 1928. A committee of military, business, and intelligentsia interests have governed the country without a constitution ever since. Despite their best efforts, political unrest has never quite ended, and the harsh hand of the military has only been stayed by cooler heads. Pressure from the Emperor has pushed the junta to allow for controlled elections in 1933 in the hope that the veneer of democracy will quell public anger."
  PB_MEX_Revolutionary_Legacy:0 "Legacy of 1878"
  PB_MEX_Revolutionary_Legacy_desc:0 "The Great Northern Revolution, known in Mexico proper as the Great Northern Rebellion, was the collapse of Mexico City's authority in their Northern provinces. The catastrophic defeat of Imperial forces lead to the secession of Tejas, Santa Fe, Rio Grande, Yucatan and California, and destroyed Mexico's repuation as a regional power. Even decades later, the wounds of the 1878 Revolutions are still raw for the Empire, and the reactionary government response drove much of Mexico's scientific and educational talent North to greener pastures."
