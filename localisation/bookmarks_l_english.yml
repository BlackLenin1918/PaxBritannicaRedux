 PAX_BRITANNICA_NAME:0 "Pax Britannica"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The year is 1936, and once more the world stands on the edge of war. The Austrian Reich, birthed from the post-war resentment of their defeat, has swallowed much of the Balkans. The provisional Weimar Government in Germany collapsed along ideological lines. The states of the Italian peninsula stand at a crossroads. Even the East, with the princes of India and the fledgeling Chinese democracy, seem poised to dive once more into darkness. A single spark my be all it takes."
 ENG_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "Though the British Empire would survive the perils of the First Great War, it had been irrevocably damaged in the trenches of France. The commonwealth, once the cornerstone of the empire, has begun to break apart at the seams. Radicalism has begun to take hold throughout the British Isles, with the likes of Oswald Mosley’s Union of Fascists and the British Communist Party vying for public support. With old enemies seeking to settle the score, the Empire and its’ commonwealth faces the greatest threat it has ever known. The Pax Britannica is about to come to a screeching halt."
 FRA_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "France has always been a conflicted nation. From the Revolution of 1789 that established the Bourbon constitutional monarchy to the trenches of the Somme that nearly destroyed her armies, the nation has always been handicapped by internal strife. This decade has been no different. An old enemy has arisen in Austria, threatening to drag Europe once more into the clutches of war. With her colonial empire becoming increasingly unstable and her politics gridlocked by infighting, it seems only a miracle can save France from total annihilation."
 AUS_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "When the fires of the First Great War were finally extinguished, the nations of the Central Powers found themselves stripped and shattered by the victorious Entente. None was so humiliated as Austria-Hungary, who was shattered alongside the Ottomans. In the years since the war, the ultranationalist Fatherland front has risen to power, leading the Austrian army to seize back many of their old territories. The Osterreich now sets its’ attentions on former enemies, intending to take back not just their territory, but their national pride. The Austrians shall regain their honor, no matter the cost in blood."
 TUR_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The ‘tertiary’ nation of the Central Powers, the Turkish nation has for years sat in shambles, even despite the lenient Treaty of Lausanne, which revised the harsher Sevres treaty that utterly dismembered the empire. Resolved to restore honor to their country, different visions of the Turkish future spar in the courts and senate for prominence among the oligarchs currently in control of the state. Should the Sultan take more power or less? Should he be deposed of outright? Turkey's neigbors anxiously watch as the nation of Suleiman the Magnificent prepares to once again assume its place at the forefront of the world."
 SOV_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "Russia’s entry into the First Great War proved her undoing. Defeat after defeat bolstered opposition until Emperor himself was forced to abdicate. Despite the promises of the new Kerensky-led government, Russia collapsed into civil war. Lenin’s Bolsheviks fought on, their ranks reinforced by the many ethnic nations that broke away from the Empire. In the end, however, the intervention of the Entente powers brought Lenin’s revolution to an end. Almost a decade later, Russia remains under the military government of Alexander Kolchak. Facing opposition from all sides, the fate of Russia now lies in the hands of Kolchak."
 CHI_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "Out of the Xinhai Revolution was born the Republic of China, the first true Chinese democracy. Under the leadership of Sun Yat-Sen, the nation has seen a tumultuous past. Threatened by internal strife, attempted coups and military blunders, the Republic sits on the knife’s edge of stability. China has made many enemies in both Tokyo and Moscow, both of which would enjoy nothing more than to strangle the burgeoning superpower in the crib. Facing down its’ rivals colonial ambitions, China must fight enemies within and without if it is to survive the coming years."
 JAP_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "Japan, though an opportunistic victor of the First Great War, stands at a crossroads. Facing increasing economic pressure and a lack of resources, many in the government see imperialism as the only solution. The National Diet, Japan’s congress, remains in a state of political gridlock between the liberal and conservative opposition. Quiet voices in back rooms whisper rumors of a military coup, while the Imperial court seeks a full restoration of the Emperor’s powers. The future of Japan is at stake and the land of the rising sun must decide whether glory shall come by the pen or by the sword."
# CAN_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The armies of Canada stood beside the British in the trenches of the First Great War, fighting alongside their comrades for a brighter future. That future, it seems, never arrived. Hampered by postwar recession, Canada has only recently been able to climb back from the brink. Now, Ottawa finds itself standing atop the American powder keg. Between Tacoma’s expansionistic ambitions and Mexico’s fading empire, it seems that Canada, and Canada alone, must safeguard British power in North America. As the Second Great War seems ever nearer, the northern nation may find itself once more in the trenches alongside it’s European comrades. "

 OTHER_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the First Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
# FIN_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:1 "The Finnish people have long suffered beneath the boots of the Russian Empire. Shunned and oppressed, their rebellions were stamped out consistently by the authorities of the Russian Tsar. It seemed that the Finns would forever suffer under Russian rule. When the First Great War struck Europe and brought Russia to its knees, the Finns saw their opportunity. Rallying behind ultranationalist ideals, the Finnish peoples seized not just their independence but control of historic Russian lands. Now, decades later, the northern nation finds itself at a crossroads, as a new war is on the horizon, and an old enemy has begun to rise from the grave."
# AST_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
# SAF_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
# NZL_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
# RAJ_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
# CZE_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "Gaining independence after the Great war, the Czechs are finally a free nation after more than 500 years under Austrian rule. But after only 15 years, the Austrians have came back starting months of border skirmishes trying to legitimate a war, unsuccessfully. Surrounded by enemies and war, thats bringing more and more refugees into our small republic every day, the Czechs now stay before a major decision, take a revenge on Austrian blood, or try to prosper alone? Will the pearl of Europe rise again?, or will it be lost in history books forever."
