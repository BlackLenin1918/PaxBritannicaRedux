 PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The year is 1936, and once more the world stands on the edge of war. The Austrian Reich, birthed from the post-war resentment of their defeat, has swallowed much of the Balkans. The provisional Weimar Government in Germany collapsed along ideological lines. The states of the Italian peninsula stand at a crossroads. Even the East, with the princes of India and the fledgeling Chinese democracy, seem poised to dive once more into darkness. A single spark my be all it takes."
 ENG_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The British Empire, once the undisputed ruler of the world, stands at the weakest point in their long history. The Great War broke the old Concert of Europe, once so dutifully maintained by diplomats and leaders. Britain, caught up in the conflict, sacrificed millions of their soldiers across the French and Iberian fronts. While Europe languished in their postwar depression, Britain retreated into isolationism, relying on an increasingly disfunctional system of imperial trade. With their Imperial Confederation appearing archaic and the Constituent Commonwealths more assertive, Britain faces a myriad of threats with and without."
 FRA_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "Rising from the ashes of their catastrophic defeat in the Great War, France is a nation reborn. The failures of the Bourbon dynasty have paved the way for the rise of ultranationalist fervor. Germany and Britain have suffered weakness and failure, while the peoples of France waited, regaining their strength. Under the guiding hand of Grand Marshall Doriot, France is once again able to stand up to the perfidious Germans and reclaim her rightful place as Europe's dominant power."
