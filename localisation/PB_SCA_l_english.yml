  POLITICS_Smedley_Butler_Exile_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 30/7/1881\n\n§YSmedley Butler§! is failed man with a failed dream. With the defeat of the American-Jacobin Revolution Butler and his disciples marched west into untamed America in hopes of a new life. The result was the death of many and those who were the "lucky" bunch soon found out why the settlers of the old America failed in their ambitions. Whilst their greatest foe is the Commonwealth, second ranks nature and her desire to elevate the human struggle to the rest of the animal kingdom.\n\nNow begins the greatest test of all, to see what it truely takes to break a man, and an idea.\n\n§RSic semper tyrannis§! is a Latin phrase meaning "thus always to tyrants". It suggests that bad outcomes should or eventually will befall tyrants, and that shall be out motto."

  PB_SCA_The_First_Cracks_desc:0 "Despite our limited resources the Continental Army has already started to show the first signs of factionalism. Being a big organisation that attracts every kind of revolutionary under the sun and moon, it’s the simple nature of our current situation that has created these cracks in our army. From anarchists to statists and from democratic Jacobins to centralists, our army is a diverse bunch of minds all devoted to their ideal expression of the revolution. While factionalism currently remains low due to our revolution, if the revolution succeeds in continuing to burn we will have to address this issue or suffer from the ensuing splintering of the working men’s revolution."

  PB_SCA_The_Young_Old_And_Bold_desc:0 "With our roots in the Bonus Army and the Great War Veterans that demanded their payment from the imperial government, it is no wonder that a large chunk of the fighting men and leading revolutionaries are relatively old and experienced, having learned from their times in the trenches of Iberia. It is also no surprise that we also have a relatively large young section of the Continental Army, made up of aspiring revolutionaries and Jacobins. This has caused a bit of a divide between the older moderates and orthodox figures and the younger radicals.\n\nDespite our difference in age, we all have many things in common. We dare to dream and take big steps, taking risks for our beliefs and fighting for our ideas of justice. While one’s face may look like a corpse and another’s face may look like he was just born, we all fight for the same revolution. "

  SCA1title:0 "The Dead March West"
  SCA1desc:0 "The roads that many followed laid high in viscous mixtures of blood and dirt with the occasional sight of a corpse becoming the permanent spectacle for the trek. Once dawn came eveyone prepared themselves to once again follow the dirt road left by the failed settlers of the old America. For those who were too weak to continue walking their fate was not so prestigious. They became yet another figure on an already increasing list of "who was dead". It was a blindly sight to see sons beg for their fathers to get up, and the age divide only worsened with much of the old laying claim to heaven, or hell. Amongst the red skies festered disease, rampant starvation, and a total dissaray of society. From three hundred thousand of the intial pilgrims only an estimated one hundred thousand survived. If the commonwealth so wished to chase after us then they would have all the directions needed. It seemed Hansel and Gretel ran out of bread, but not bodies, that they had plenty of. Even when Butler proclaimed our new home all one had to do was turn and look at those damn dirt roads to be reminded of what happened. \n\nOur sons who sacrificed so much will have their revenge, or at the very least bathe in the blood of their brothers.\n\nDeath To The Commonwealth!"

The food situation had already begun deteriorating at this point and rationing had already taken effect. The streets were battered with sand and the definition of hell seemed all to fitting for the situation at hand. The local militias while not uttering a word of hesitance were all to knowledge about the current circumstances. They remained the only people able to still maintain a full belly, them and the various political leaders. Even the veterans were on the short end of the stick. The new Butlerites began being set new homes and rations and the core population looked towards them with distaste and concern. The worst had just begun. "

Shouted a citizen pointing at an old scrunched up figure. At closer inspection of the individual and old crested face revealed itself. "What will she provide now?" Added the engraged citizen as the crowd roared in unison. The old lady coerced with Butler showing to him a small timid boy under her arms. "Now listen hear dear, my son, this boy's father, gave everything to the cause. He died believing in you, in the revolution." Reaching out with her crooked finger she tapped Butlers heart. "If not me surely the boy?" She stood undisturbed at the possibilty of turning back, she knew her time was near but remained defiant at the suggestion of her grandson dying out in these wastes."

Commonwealth forces have intercepted our comrades in Hardin, trapping them between the Illinois and the Mississippi. 25,000 soldiers are now caught in a mouse trap, 25,000 fighters we can’t afford to lose. A relief force could be sent but we are already stretched so thin. One cynical officer suggests sending “the unreliable” troops in reserves instead, but that would certainly be sending these people to their deaths…."
