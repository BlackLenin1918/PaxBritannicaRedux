  britain.1.d:0 "The last days of Britain's King-Emperor were spent in a musty room in Sandringham House, breaking out of consciousness only for the briefest moments to ask about the Empire. Each time the nurses would reassure him, and each time he lapsed back into a daze. Day by day, Edward watched his father fall further and further into the clutches of death. Less than a month ago, he'd approached him to marry, and now he sat at the deathbed of a father who barely even recognized him.\n\nGeorge, for his part, had little to ruminate on but regrets during his brief pangs of awareness. Regrets that he could not be like his father, regrets that he could not be the same great man who had steered his state through the Catastrophe. Had he been more lucid, perhaps he and his son would have that common foundation, but his mind was lost in a morphine induced mist.\n\nThe hour finally came in the dead of night, as George's nurse administered one last dose of sedatives. The sun rose on an Empire without a king and a son without a father. "

Of particular concern is the brutality of the attack, with many of those killed having been hacked to death with improvised bladed weapons.\n\nMore problematic is that since these reports were filed, at least four other similar attacks have occurred. Some of the soldiers have cheekily referred to the incidents as the 'Machete Rebellion'. Though it has not reached the point of a full scale uprising, the tension between the locals and the settlers is palpable, even in major cities.

The Danish royal family remains in exile, and there is a concern among the military leadership that the overseas provinces may choose to join the French collaborator regime, potentially giving France greater access to the Atlantic. This is a situation that we cannot allow to happen.\n\nBacked by the Royal Navy, Imperial Marines landed on the shores of the Faroe Islands and Iceland during the night. Caught off guard, the small Danish garrisons, already demoralized by news of Copenhagen's defeat, were quickly disarmed. Though clearly not pleased with the turn of events, there was little that the Danes could do to prevent the occupation. As of this morning, reports indicate that we now have full control over the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland. Any pro-French elements of the local populations have been arrested by IIS agents and remanded to POW facilities in Scotland for interrogation."

Despite this, the Icelandic Althing has continued operating as though the occupation were not happening at all. In fact, many of Iceland's politicians have been pushing for an open declaration of independence from Denmark. Sveinn Björnsson, a vocal critic of the occupation, declared to crowds in Reykjavík that Iceland would seek full patriation from Denmark. All this talk of independence has begun to make the occupation authorities uneasy. The last thing we need is insurrection on an island as inhospitable as Iceland.\n\nFrom this unease has come a handful of proposals to London on how best to resolve the Icelandic dissent. The most obvious solution is to simply end the occupation, granting Iceland independence in exchange for remaining in the Imperial Powers until the war is finished. A more radical solution, popular among British warhawks, is to pressure the Althing into accepting a constitutional monarchy and commonwealth status under the British Empire. Such a move would be an outrage to the Danes, but as it stands right now they aren't in much of a position to do more than protest. Simply remaining on the island and continuing the occupation would be deeply unpopular with both the Icelandic people and our own, as well as a drain on our resources, but it would ensure we have the most control over Reykjavík's ports."

The Commonwealth of Ireland was originally established to prevent these kinds of uprisings, but it seems Irish rebellion is an inevitable issue regardless. There have been some proposals on how we can resolve the situation.\n\nThe first and most obvious is to simply reinstate the Commonwealth government, albeit with slightly more oversight from the British forces already deployed in the region. The Ulster Free State will be reintegrated into the Irish Commonwealth as well. Alternatively, it has been proposed that Ulster be integrated into the United Kingdom instead. The sectarian conflicts in the region might be better controlled under a direct British administration. The most extreme proposal from the imperial hardliners is for Ireland to be re-annexed into the United Kingdom entirely, a move that would likely inflame Anglo-Irish tensions even further.

  britain.1011.d:0 "Gallacher's election to the Prime Ministership has caused a not inconsiderable rift within the Worker's Union Party between the radicals and the reformists. The decidedly anarchist direction which Gallacher's cabinet has taken the party has caused the reformist faction, headed by Mosley and Attlee, to become disillusioned with the WUP. They continually fight against the most important reforms of Gallacher's platform, and party infighting makes it difficult to use our parliamentary support to our advantage.\n\nIn light of this, Gallacher has assembled a coalition of the radical party heads from throughout the WUP and proposed an alliance with the United Republican Front. A fringe Jacobin faction, the URF has remained a vocal but largely powerless left wing faction in Britain for some time. Gallacher believes that aligning with the URF and rallying his supporters in the United Trade Unions will give him the political support to oust Mosley and Attlee from their positions of authority in the WUP. The move would be extremely risky, as the reformists make up a not inconsiderable portion of the party leadership. Disempowering them could potentially handicap the WUP or even split the party, even if it would give us a freer hand in passing legislation."

Claiming that Gallacher has hijacked the party with his radical anarchist ideals, Mosley and Attlee have left the WUP and taken a significant portion of the party with them, accounting for a considerable portion of the party's reformist branch.\n\nThe two have even gone so far as to found a new political party, calling themselves the \"Labour Party\" and drawing the support of many of the WUP's disillusioned moderates. This has been a catastrophe for our parliamentary support, but thankfully the support of the UTU and the radicals has become even stronger.

If we don't put a stop to this power jockeying now, it could have serious consequences for the first WUP government."

The report, delivered by agents of the Imperial Security Service, contained a series of reports by Jordanian and Palestinian travelers that a white man traveling alone in the Jordanian desert has been spotted on multiple occasions. It went on to indicate a high probability that the man being referred to may be the missing British Colonel Thomas Edward Lawrence, though it cannot confirm this with absolute certainty.\n\nLawrence vanished from his posting in the Trucial States following the end of hostilities in the Great War. The reason for his disappearence is unknown, but colleagues attested to the ISS that his service during the North African campaign and the Arab Peacekeeping operations may have pushed him over the edge. Lawrence's fascination with the Middle East is well known, and ISS agents have been combing the Arab Kingdoms for almost two decades in an effort to locate him. If this lead is to be believed, Lawrence may have been hiding beneath our noses this entire time. Our ISS office in Jerusalem has advised that we dispatch an agent to Jordan to locate this unidentified man post haste, as we may lose our chance to find him with the brewing chaos in the Near East."

Evidence of recent habitation was found, particularly several opened cans of food and a recently snuffed out campfire. Before the agents could investigate further, the cocking of a pistol drew the agents' attention to their flank.\n\nThere, masked in the amber glow of the setting desert sun, stood T.E Lawrence, though at first he was hardly recognizable. Dirty, unshaven and draped in Arab garb, he hardly looked anything like the file photo the agents had been given.\n\n\"I figured you people would come looking for me eventually.\"\n\n\"We're with Imperial Intelligence, we've been asked to bring you in for reassign-\"\n\n\"I'm not going back. Not after what we did.\"\n\nThe agents looked amongst one another, and after a tense silence, the head of the operation spoke, hand lingering near his revolver."

Ozymandias demanded his service once more, to protect his empire one last time before it slipped from his fingers and into the dustbin of history. It didn't matter if it was King Edward or King George, the Emperors were all the same.\n\nStill, in a way he figured he owed his homeland some courtesy for not putting him down like a rabid dog. Sometimes, a hound gone wild still has use left in him for his master. One last ride, he figured, one last ride for the Empire.\n\nOne last ride and he could finally be free, spilling blood just this one time more in exchange for freedom.\n\nThey left the next morning for the border of the mandate, and though Lawrence couldn't shake his pessimism, he did have to admit it would be nice to have a proper bed again."

The French garrison had refused to surrender, and his body shook when he recalled how their commanders had simply shrugged and given the order to open fire. Tens of thousands of tonnes of steel hellfire raining down on a city of nearly a million, and he just sat back and watched, and he swore he would never raise a rifle for the Empire again.\n\nThe agents left silently, riding off home to their masters. Lawrence continued on as though they had never came, pouring over endless tomes of obscure Arabian history. Perhaps, he figured, one day he might make the trip to Mecca once this terrible succession war business blows over.\n\nThe contents of the Lawrence report submitted to the IIS were unremarkable, and few questioned the statements on some Great War fossil lost in his own madness in a savage desert. The report was filed away among the millions of reports in the IIS archives, disappearing into an ocean of bureaucracy, and with it went the last memories of Colonel Lawrence."

  britain.2004.d:0 "The shrieks of gunfire broke the silence as the agents opened up on him, catching the Colonel off guard. Bullets ripped through him, knocking him back as he landed face first in the sand. As blood pooled around him, his fading vision caught one last glimpse of the setting desert sun, the light reflecting off his own blood as it mixed with the sweeping sand.\n\nColonel Lawrence bled to death an hour later, hogtied on the back of a camel headed back to Palestine. Though the agents tasked with acquiring him received a chewing out, most in the IIS concluded the man was a loose cannon. It wasn't their job to rescue some Great War veteran from his own madness, after all.\n\nColonel Lawrence found his resting place a little over a month later in a Veteran's cemetary in Wales. Though the grave was periodically the host to small gatherings by veterans of the Algiers Campaign, over time the meetings would fade away, along with whatver memory of Colonel Lawrence that might have remained."

I understand my disappearance may have caused some concerns, however I feel that it would be a terrible waste of manpower to send any more chaps to kill me. As a token of my good will, I've attached this letter to the remains of the poor men you've sent to their deaths and I should hope their remains have made it to Palestine unscathed.\n\nIf you continue sending killers, I'll send a very fast working one to Jerusalem and I certainly won't have to send another."

  britain.2006.d:0 "Princess Mary, the only daughter of his late Imperial Majesty King-Emperor George V, announced her engagement to American businessman and veteran Quentin Roosevelt. The announcement came as something of a surprise for the public, though the contact between the two had been an open secret within the royal family.\n\nDriven out of seclusion by the Great War, Princess Mary helped launch a series of charity campaigns in Britain to support veterans. Roosevelt, on leave in the isles due to being wounded on the Iberian front, briefly met the princess at a charity event and the two began correspondance. Roosevelt's status as a war hero in the Americas and his family standing among the American aristocracy paved the way for celebrity across the Empire. Both continued their efforts for Veterans charities while corresponding, ultimately leading to their engagement.\n\nThe marriage of the two marks the most official formation of ties between the Americas and Britain, with American and British hardline loyalists lauding the affair as an example of the Anglo-American imperial identity. The King-Emperor has remained largely quiet on the affairs of his sister, and the rest of the Royal Family has given the courtship a bregruding approval."

  britain.2007.t:0 "The Rise of the Swing Scene"
  britain.2007.d:0 "British propaganda has always emphasized the so called \"Mixing Pot\" of the Empire, and no development demonstrates this further than the growth of London's underground music culture. Heavily influenced by immigration from the Americas during the Bleeding South, \"Swing\" music has become a craze among Britain's youth.\n\nEmphasizing big bands, trumpets and string compositions, Swing music developed as a local phenomena among Black American immigrants and soon mixed with the cultural milieu of Great Britain. Taking influence from everything from German orchestra to local folk tunes, the development of Swing music in Britain has birthed something wholly unique, and despite the best efforts of moral censors, it seems rowdy kids can't get enough of it."

  britain.2008.d:0 "Established in 1929, the British Surrealist Group finally organized their first official showing in London to a select audience. During the event, the group unveiled a series of pieces alongside a lengthy document detailing the so-called \"Doctrine of Inexplicability\". In Britain, the Surrealist movement remains nascent, but since the late 1920s has been greatly expanded by the introduction of French and Spanish exiles. The most notable of these is Spanish painter Salvador Domènech, whose bizarre pieces and eccentric behaviour form the backbone of the group's published manifesto.\n\nLargely existing as a rejection of postwar British art culture, which had shifted towards realism and darker themes as a reflection of the country's economic malaise. Surrealism, rather, rejects the idea of realism and instead focuses purely on the fantastical. The first exhibition of the group has garnered both praise and criticism, as more traditional voices in the art world decry the concept as \"art without meaning.""

  britain.2009.d:0 "Dignitaries from across Europe arrived in London today to celebrate the royal marriage of King-Emperor Edward VIII to Helen von Hohenzollern. One of several princesses of Prussia, Helen's marriage to the British King further cements the ties between the British royal family and Germany.\n\nWhile not a member of Germany's ruling royal family, the Habsburgs, Helen's descendance from the Hohenzollern family of Brandenburg-Prussia is no less prestigious. More importantly, the Hohenzollern's Protestantism is much less of a barrier to a royal marriage than the Catholic Habsburgs."
  britain.2009.a:0 "As if the Royal Family wasn't already German enough."

  britain.2010.t:0 "Edward announces his intent to Marry"
  britain.2010.d:0 "Edward, the heir presumptive to King-Emperor George V, has approached his father with the intention to marry Princess Helen von Hohenzollern. The relationship between the two has been largely kept under wraps for the last few years, however with the King's health rapidly declining, Edward wishes to ensure his blessing before his condition degrades further.\n\nThough George's mental state is in decline, he retained his faculties enough to at least sign off on the marriage. Despite Edward's hopes, however, the open support of his father continues to elude him and George lapsed back into a malaise almost immediately after the conversation. Though he did not show it, his father's bouts of delusion clearly weighed on Edward, and he quickly left his father's side to announce the engagement.\n\nWhat would have been one of the most important days in his life would, as always, be tempered by his ever elusive father's emotional distance."

  britain.2011.t:0 "Formation of the Scottish Independence Party"
  britain.2011.d:0 "Ever the most unruly part of Britain proper, the various political parties in Scotland have long agitated for varying degrees of independence or autonomy from Britain. Just today, members of the Scottish Independence League and the Movement for Scottish Autonomy announced their merger to form the Scottish Independence Party, or SIP.\n\nA big tent coalition of Scottish conservatives, liberals, nationalists and progressives, the SIP is currently dysfunctional at best. What is most notable about this is that the party unilaterally agitates for Scotland to, at the very least, be granted Commonwealth status and a seat in the Imperial Parliament. Naturally such an idea has seen pushback from the English political scene, though some radical elements of the WUP have argued in favor of this Devolution policy."

  britain.2013.d:0 "The declining health of the King-Emperor is no secret among the Royal Family or the government. His governance of Britain during the years after the Great War took a heavy toll on him mentally and physically. The last few months have been much harder than anyone could have expected. Complications from his habitual smoking and a respiratory infection have left him largely bedridden, further depressing his mental state.\n\nThough doctors have kept him on a strict regimen of medications, he has continued to degrade mentally. Many of the royal family believe his death will come sooner rather than later, and so they have returned to London to be with the King during his final days."

A further announcement came that he would be conducting regular radio addresses to the country, attempting to answer questions from the public and further \"build bridges between the king and his countrymen.\"\n\nAs expected, the speech saw wide support from the public, though some on the left grumbled about Edward's seeming intention to re-emphasize the monarchy in British politics."

In a lavish ceremony, British nobility and corporate officials celebrated the completion of the canal and the splendor of the Empire's economic might. The announcement was soon followed by the formation of the Nicaragua Canal Company, a state-managed Imperial Corporation which will be responsible for policing and maintaining the Canal's facilities.\n\nThe occasion has not been entirely without controversy, as the Nicaraguan government voiced displeasure at their minimal role in the NCC, which will see them see very few of the dividends from the canal taxes. Some more radical elements of the government outright denounced the British and have avowed their efforts to take back supposedly rightful Nicaraguan land. Controversy still surrounds the canal even beyond this, as many British reformists argued against the use of poorly paid locals and African \"travel workers\", the latter of which received almost no pay at all save room and provisions. Nevertheless, Britain has acquired yet another powerful economic chip in global geopolitics. Alongside the Suez, Britain has a tremendously powerful monopoly on global and inter-empire trade."

  britain.4007.d:0 "The United Kingdom has, traditionally, sat as the de-facto head of the British Empire in spite of the propaganda about equality. The last great reform of the Confederation will rectify this issue and dramatically change the aspect of our Empire. Signed into action by the Britain's Ministers of Imperial Parliament, the [GetYear] Act of Commonwealth establishes the United Kingdom as a co-equal partner with the Empire's Commonwealths. No longer acting as superior, the United Kingdom will remain the headquarters of the Imperial Parliament, but will no longer maintain some of their legislative privileges. Among the many policies of the Act include greater autonomy for Scotland and Wales as part of the Commonwealth, though outright independence or Commonwealth status seems unlikely for the forseeable future.\n\nThe sole unifying factor of the Empire will now be the imperial crown, with the King-Emperor and his wife assuming a rotating residency across the various Commonwealths every four years. Under this new system, the British Empire has fully embraced the high ideals of the Imperial Confederation, creating a loosely aligned alliance of nations under the British crown. What the future may hold for this bold experiment remains to be seen, but for now, celebrations go on across the Empire.\n\nThe Sun has set on the moribund Imperial experiment, and tomorrow a new dawn will shine over a people, perhaps disparate, but for the first time in decades united in common cause."

  ENG_Edward_VIII_Desc:0 "His Majesty, King-Emperor Edward VIII has arisen to the crown with the death of his father, King George V. He finds himself reigning over a troubled nation, and an even more troubled empire. Noted for his open distaste for the rising popularity of the Worker's Union party, many leftists now fear that Edward might abandon his political neutrality as King to interfere in politics. Amidst economic and political uncertainty, Edward's rise to power and lack of concern for constitutional processes has done little to ease the government's worries."
  ENG_King_George_Desc:0 "Born George Frederick Ernest Albert in 1865, His Royal Highness King George V, Emperor of India and the British Empire, is in many ways a man that lives within the shadow of his father. Succeeding Edward VII after his death in 1910, George inherited an empire utterly traumatized by the single most horrific conflict in human history. With Europe clutched tight in the grip of economic depression, only economic isolationism could prevent privation, and so George V oversaw the establishment of Britain's diplomatic and economic isolationism from Europe. George V is most known for the catastrophic failure of the Indian Campaign, which saw the warhawk conservative goverment attempt to bolster their popularity with a quick campaign into India, hoping to finally rectify a black stain on British imperial history. George V openly endorsed the campaign and, when British forces were forced to halt due to heavy losses, his credability and the credability of the conservatives was badly damaged. This would ultimately force the conservatives into a coalition government with the Whig party in the subsequent elections. Now, in 1933, George's health has begun to fail him. Frequently ill and delegating affairs to the rest of the Royal family, many fear that George's death is imminent."
