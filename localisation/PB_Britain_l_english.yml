  ENG_Prime_Minister_Kenney_desc:0 "Annie Kenney has been elected as Prime Minister following an Independent Labour Victory"

  ENG_Mental_Hygiene_Act:0 "The Mental Hygiene Act"
  ENG_Mental_Hygiene_Act_desc:0 "The greatest threat to the British peoples is that of Communist thought. If we are to rid ourselves of this existential threat, all vestiges of Bolshevik thought must be uprooted and destroyed. Being a red in the most prosperous Empire in the world is insane, after all. The new Prime Minister proposes a plan that would ensure that Britain remains communist-free for the forseeable future."

  ENG_Churchill_Doctrine:0 "The Churchill Doctrine"
  ENG_Churchill_Doctrine_desc:0 "The British Empire must endeavor to fight Bolshevism wherever it may lie, whether it be in the smallest Asian minor to our own neighbors. If one nation falls to Communist thought, than the next will fall, on and on until vast swathes of the world collapse to Neo-Marxist thought. We must be the vanguard against this."

  ENG_Reinforce_British_Dominance:0 "Reinforce British Dominance"
  ENG_Reinforce_British_Dominance_desc:0 "Britain must always remain the preeminent empire of the world. There can be no substitutes. We must always ensure that the government in France understands its’ place. The British hegemon shall stand, now and forever."

  ENG_Status_Quo:0 "Status Quo Governance"
  ENG_Status_Quo_desc:0 "As the leader of the largest global hegemony in history, Britain has an obligation to fight for the status quo whenever possible. Empire is about more than just the path to power or prosperity, it is an obligation to help maintain the peace and prosperity of all our constituent peoples."

  ENG_Reinforce_British_Canals:0 "Fortify the International Canals"
  ENG_Reinforce_British_Canals_desc:0 "The British government currently directly administrates the two largest shipping canals in the world. The Suez and Victoria Canals, in Egypt and Panama respectively, have been a major boon for the government in terms of taxable revenue. Reinforcing these canals with new fortifications would go along way to keeping them under our control in the event of war."

  ENG_Imperial_Investments:0 "Imperial Investment Committee"
  ENG_Imperial_Investments_desc:0 "Many of our colonies have infrastructure and industry that is a bit wanting. To combat this, an Imperial Investment Committee has been proposed to provide funding to local industries to help the Empire though these difficult times."

  ENG_National_Housing_Act:0 "The National Housing Act"
  ENG_National_Housing_Act_desc:0 "Since the end of the Great War, the economic troubles have left thousands of our citizens either in deep poverty or outright homeless. Establishing the National Housing Act would go a long way towards combatting this issue. Under the act, large areas of major cities would be devoted to new, inexpensive low-income housing intended to provide people their basic needs while they find work."

  ENG_Pan_Anglo_Ideals:0 "Pan-Anglo Idealism"
  ENG_Pan_Anglo_Ideals_desc:0 "The concept of Pan-Angloism has been around since the creation of the Commonwealth system, following the Washington Rebellion. Falling in and out of favor for years, it is time that we finally commit to the ideal of a Pan-Anglo state, uniting Britain with her North American dominions. It is time for the Anglo and Anglo-American peoples to finally unite as one."

  ENG_British_Imperial_Federation:0 "The British Imperial Federation"
  ENG_British_Imperial_Federation_desc:0 "The British Imperial Federation has been Attlee’s pet project since he first came to power in Labour, arguing for a united federation of Britain and her North American territories. The concept is extremely ambitious, but if successful, could create greater stability and unity between Britain and her Dominions."

  ENG_New_Machine:0 "The New Machines"
  ENG_New_Machine_desc:0 "A key tenant of Mosley’s campaign was the expansion of local British industries. These new industries would help to increase available work to the population and combat the widespread poverty caused by the economic crisis."

  ENG_Nationalize_Heavy_Industry:0 "Nationalize Heavy Industry"
  ENG_Nationalize_Heavy_Industry_desc:0 "Many heavy industries like mining went under following the Stock Crisis. Nationalizing these industries would allow work to continue, providing vital employment for the people and revenue for the government."

  ENG_Economic_Self_Sufficiency:0 "The Mosley Sufficiency Plan"
  ENG_Economic_Self_Sufficiency_desc:0 "The United Kingdom remains economically dependent on her empire for imports and exports, a system that while functional during peacetime, could be a threat during wartime. Mosley’s self-sufficiency plan calls for a dramatic increase in local production to shift Britain from economic dependency to economic independence."

  ENG_Encourage_Unionism:0 "Encourage Labour Unionism"
  ENG_Encourage_Unionism_desc:0 "As a former Union leader, Blair’s administration has been heavily influenced by the British Trade Union Council. Blair himself advocates for unionization in all industries, and his administration should work to support that ideal."

  ENG_Colonial_Literacy_Campaigns:0 "Colonial Literacy Campaigns"
  ENG_Colonial_Literacy_Campaigns_desc:0 "Many colonies in the British Empire are woefully illiterate, which makes transition to home rule governments difficult. Promoting literacy and education in regions like Bengal and Africa will make it far easier to create post-colonial transitional governments."

  ENG_Decolonization:0 "Begin the Decolonization Programme"
  ENG_Decolonization_desc:0 "The Imperial policies of Britain should largely shift towards emancipation, rather than imperialism. We should begin shifting towards allowing the colonies and dominions their own governments."

  ENG_Womens_Clubs:0 "The English Women's League"
  ENG_Womens_Clubs_desc:0 "Women’s clubs in the United Kingdom have been relatively commonplace in recent years. We should promote these clubs via a united English Women’s League, promoting the cause of suffrage and women’s rights in Britain and the Empire abroad."

  ENG_London_Suffrage_Conference:0 "The London Suffrage Conference"
  ENG_London_Suffrage_Conference_desc:0 "To expand on Kenney’s push for women’s rights in the Empire, a Suffrage Conference has been proposed in London to expand women’s roles in British society. Plans for women in the military, air force and even the Royal Navy have been proposed."

  ENG_Military_Women:0 "Women in the Military"
  ENG_Military_Women_desc:0 "Women make up a not inconsiderable percentage of the United Kingdom and the Empire. Allowing them to operate, even in non-combat roles, would greatly expand our military capacity."

  ENG_London_Stock_Crisis_Tooltip:0 "§R The London Stock Crisis has occurred §!\n"

  ENG_Crown_Corporation_Compromise:0 "Maintain the Crown Corporations"
  ENG_Crown_Corporation_Compromise_desc:0 "Though the crown corporations may be a drain on our resources, they are still a vital part of the Imperial Economy. A compromise could be made to maintain these companies, while dramatically reducing their funding to lessen the weight on the economy."

  # GREAT BRITAIN IDEAS
  #########################

  PB_ENG_Import_Reliant_Economy:0 "Import Reliant Economy"
  PB_ENG_Import_Reliant_Economy_desc:0 "Britain’s very nature forces it to rely heavily on imports from her colonies and abroad. Though Britain’s agricultural and industrial base is nothing to scoff at, it nonetheless suffers from a lack of immediate access to materials. Thus, a significant portion of the economy remains perpetually dedicated to importing goods from the Empire."
  PB_ENG_economic_stagnation:0 "Economic Stagnation"
  PB_ENG_economic_stagnation_desc:0 "Though Britain still remains a strong economic power, the nation has suffered a lengthy period of financial stagnation since the end of hostilities in 1919. The Commonwealth was largely shielded from the economic crash following the Weimar Civil War due to their isolationist, protectionist economic policies. Even still, internal Imperial trade can only go so far, and the Home Isles have finally begun to feel the pinch."
  PB_ENG_Irish_Republican_Army:0 "The Irish Republican Army"
  PB_ENG_Irish_Republican_Army_desc:0 "The Easter Rising in 1919, along with the subsequent Battle of Dublin, was a pivotal event in the move for Irish Independence. It was also a pivotal moment in British policy towards Ireland, which has taken a distinctly repressive turn since the event. Though a token Dublin Parliament was later established, it retains very little power and largely remains a puppet of London. In the years since the Rising, various disparate Irish groups representing nearly every ideology imaginable have taken up the mantle of Irish Independence. If not handled carefully, the whole of Ireland could explode into open rebellion."
  PB_ENG_British_Economic_Sphere:0 "British Economic Sphere"
  PB_ENG_British_Economic_Sphere_desc:0 "This nation is part of the British Economic Sphere, an impromptu system of trade alliances intended to maximize trade through ports in Britain. Sometimes referred to as the “Western European Economic Zone”, nations that partake in this enjoy a greater degree of economic stability thanks to access to British finances."

  britain.1.t:0 "The King is dead!"
  britain.1.d:0 "His Royal Majesty, King George V, died yesterday evening in his sleep. The event has been anticipated for some time, and thus his son Edward has already been appointed successor. Edward will assume the crown amidst concerns of personal relations with Wallis Simpson, a divorcee commoner from New England. While some have voiced complaints that Edward should not assume the crown due to this, most of these issues have been put by the wayside thanks to more pressing matters like growing Irish radicalism or the state of the economy. The new King-Emperor of Britain now rules over a troubled empire."
  britain.1.a:0 "Long live the King!"

  britain.2.t:0 "The London Stock Crisis!"
  britain.2.d:0 "Sparked by an investment panic, the London Stock Exchange has gone into complete freefall. The economy, previously in a state of stagnation from the Great War, has totally collapsed almost overnight. Several major corporations, particularly heavy industry and railway companies, have lost major stock and have essentially gone bankrupt. Mass unemployment has struck the entire country, with millions out of work, hungry and angry. The ripples of the Crisis are already being felt throughout the Empire, Europe and beyond."
  britain.2.a:0 "Oh. Oh no."

  britain.3.t:0 "The Tory-Liberal Coalition Collapses"
  britain.3.d:0 "With the economy in shambles, the coalition in Parliament between the Liberals and the Tories has collapsed entirely as well. The Liberals have abandoned the coalition entirely, causing a governmental crisis. Sir Anthony Eden, acting Prime Minister, has opted to call for a fresh election to try and consolidate power behind the conservatives to begin reforms. The Labour opposition, despite their competing internal factions, have announced their resolve to see the Empire through the crisis. Growing discontent among the working class has similarly grown support for the Independent Labour party, an unabashedly Marxist party spearheaded by the firebrand Unionist Eric Blair. With the Parliament dissolved, the nation now prepares for what will likely be the most contentious election in decades."
  britain.3.a:0 "Let the games begin..."

  britain.4.t:0 "General Strike!"
  britain.4.d:0 "Thanks to the ongoing economic crisis, various labour unions have capitalized on the situation to organize a general strike. For the time being, industry has ground to a half as the workers that still have jobs are campaigning for more rights. Eric Blair, head of the Independent Labour party, was notably in attendance, and gave a stirring speech encouraging workers to vote for IL to see their wishes fulfilled."

  britain.5.t:0 "The 1936 Imperial Conference"
  britain.5.d:0 "A periodic occurrence, the British Imperial Conference is set to be held this year in London. The Conference is a gathering of representatives of the British commonwealths and colonial nations, set to put forward their agendas for the next few years. This year’s conference is set to be a contentious one, particularly in regards to the question of India and American independence movements."
  britain.5.a:0 "Let's get to work."

  britain.6.t:0 "Lord Linlithgow Speaks for the Raj"
  britain.6.d:0 "The first to speak in the Conference is Lord Linlithgow, current administrator of British East India. Linlithgow has announced his intention to push for greater Indian home rule in the region, citing instances of increasingly violent pro-independence movements. These attacks have continually drained the resources of the Indian colony, and are likely being stoked by nationalist ideologues in neighboring Bihar. Linlithgow argues that Britain must support a more lenient policy towards India or risk the threat of open rebellion."
  britain.6.a:0 "Support the Indian Home Rule Programme."

  britain.6.b:0 "Refuse to support Linlithgow's absurdities."
  britain.7.t:0 "George Marshall speaks for the Dominion of America"
  britain.7.d:0 "The next speaker at the conference was Anglo-American General George Marshall. Marshall has come to London to promote the proposed “Marshall Plan.” The general argues that the American Dominion is woefully underprepared for any conflict, internal or otherwise, and is far too reliant on the British Expeditionary Force and the Royal Navy for defense. Marshall argues that his plan, which seeks to establish an official policy on Anglo-American militarization, is the only way to maintain the interests of the empire in North America from the ailing Mexican Empire and the threat of communist expansionism in the South."
  britain.7.a:0 "Support the Marshall Plan."

  britain.8.t:0 "Farouk speaks for Egypt-Sudan"
  britain.8.d:0 "Speaking for Egypt-Sudan was none other than Farouk I himself, heir to the crown of Egypt. The King, whose dynasty has operated as little more than a puppet of the empire for years, has come to make a case for greater autonomy within the British Empire. Farouk states that, with growing nationalist and communist sentiments among colonies in Africa and beyond, that providing greater home rule to the natives might help to mitigate some of the agitation. Farouk concludes, therefore, that he should be allowed to assume greater administrative powers as the King of Egypt, and should be allowed to appoint his own cabinet of his subjects alongside the British administration."

  britain.11.d:0 "In preparation for the 1937 General Elections, the parliament has officially dissolved. With the loss of the Liberal Coalition, the Tories are not projected to gain a large majority in the government, however the rising popularity of Sir Winston Churchill within the party leads some to believe otherwise. Eden himself believes that he still has hope for maintaining the Tory majority. On the other side, Labour has come out swinging with rousing speeches from party prodigy Sir Oswald Mosley and longtime party leader Clement Attlee. Similar rhetoric has arisen from the Independent Labour party, who have surged into third place popularity in the polls on the back of socialist agitation from the economic crisis."

  britain.12.t:0 "1937 Elections - Churchill denounces Blair"
  britain.12.d:0 "Winston Churchill, one of the leading candidates for Conservative party leadership, has denounced IL Leader Eric Blair as a communist sympathizer. Blair’s leftist views are well known, as is his flirtations with various Neo-Marxist parties. Churchill’s denouncement succeeding may lead to him gaining popularity within the Tories and among the population."
  britain.12.a:0 "Blair is little more than a closet communist."
  britain.12.b:0 "These accusations are absurd!"

  britain.13.t:0 "Diana Mitford speaks in Manchester"
  britain.13.d:0 "Speaking before a gathered crowd in Manchester today, Diana Mitford of the British Imperial League denounced the failures of the Eden government as being “caused by an underground bolshevik, anti-British plot” and that “Britain was being steered by the interests of her colonies, and not of her own free will.” Many have noted her specific language in reference to the Dominions and the Home Rule Policy, which Mitford herself has stated her hate for in no uncertain terms. While this kind of rhetoric from the League is not remarkable, what was notable about this incident was the sheer magnitude of people present. Mitford’s previous speaking engagements had only drawn small crowds, while the Manchester event drew thousands. Some of our advisors fear this may be the portend of something far worse than just a burgeoning right-wing extremism in Britain."
  britain.13.a:0 "Surely people can't buy into this nonsense."

  britain.14.t:0 "The Wallis Simpson Affair"
  britain.14.d:0 "An early report has come to our attention from the London Post, accusing the King of an affair with a commoner! The London Post has informed us that they intend to run the story, which provides evidence that King Edward was engaged in sexual affairs with a commoner from the Dominions named Wallis Simpson. Simpson, a two-time divorcee, is naturally not an appropriate woman for the King to be associating with, and if this reaches the presses then it may cause a scandal!"
  britain.14.a:0 "Absolutely not! Have this filth pulled from the presses!"
  britain.14.b:0 "Censorship will gain us nothing. We will deal with the consequences."

  britain.15.t:0 "Election Campaigning in London"
  britain.15.d:0 "As the 1937 Election Cycle continues, several parties have begun their campaigning in London for the local MPs. Sir Oswald Mosley delivered his typical rhetoric, while Churchill continues his “people’s” campaign of meeting with local leaders. Blair and Kenney have similarly met with local representatives of the TUC and are likely to earn the Union vote. The only question is who will win the city’s majority?"

  britain.16.d:0 "In a highly public radio debate, Labour party leader Clement Attlee debates incumbent Tory leader Anthony Eden. Attlee tore into Eden’s policies, going just short of outright blaming the Tories for the economic crisis. Eden shot back that had Labour been more willing to concede on reforms before the Crisis, that the incident might not have occurred. The conclusion of the debate was contentious, with both sides coming away inconclusively."

  britain.16.b:0 "Attlee is the clear winner."

  britain.17.t:0 "The Mosley-Mitford Papers"
  britain.17.d:0 "Shocking allegations have come forward from the London Post. According to a series of notes provided by an anonymous source, Labour Party luminary Oswald Mosley supposedly was engaged in a lengthy personal relationship with Diana Mitford of the British Imperial League. The papers allege that Sir Mosley engaged in an extramarital affair with the Ultranationalist leader, and that Labour should reconsider his membership in the party. Concerns about the validity of the papers have been raised, with Mosley himself denouncing them and claiming that they are merely a political ploy to discredit him."
  britain.17.a:0 "Perhaps something we should look in to?"
  britain.17.b:0 "Mr. Mosley did not have personal relations with that woman."

  britain.18.t:0 "The Trade Union Congress supports Blair"
  britain.18.d:0 "A surprise announcement came from the British branch of the Trade Union Congress, announcing their full support of Independent Labour candidate Eric Blair. The Congress, notable for their work in organizing strikes and pushing for worker’s rights, has flirted with open support since the London campaign, and has now formalized the decision."
  britain.18.a:0 "The Blair vote is the Fair vote!"

  britain.19.t:0 "The Liberals support Labour"
  britain.19.d:0 "An unprecedented move was made by Herbert Samuels of the Liberal party.

  britain.27.t:0 "The London Terror"
  britain.27.d:0 "A series of explosions has occurred throughout downtown London! At least fifty people have been killed, with over a hundred seriously injured. The attack has been claimed by the Irish Republican Army, who stated in a press release earlier today that it was “retribution against the imperialists in London.” This is, undeniably, the largest Irish terrorist attack in recent memory, and protests have grown in Parliament that something must be done."
  britain.27.a:0 "Put together a committee on Irish affairs. This is too far."

  britain.28.t:0 "The Mental Hygiene Act"
  britain.28.d:0 "Speaking before Parliament, Prime Minister Churchill announced his new “Mental Hygiene Act.” The Act, which would outright declare communist thought a mental illness, has been heavily criticized by Labour and Independent Labour as being a gross violation of political freedom in Britain. Concerns have also been raised by more moderate conservatives, believing that the act would grant British authorities far too much power over political thought. \n \n Under the act’s purview, major union leaders and communists would be subject to arrest, prosecution and permanent detainment in mental health facilities throughout the British Isles. IL Party Leader Eric Blair has been especially virulent in his criticisms of the act, claiming that it threatens British political thought with the same kind of authoritarianism the world witnessed with the rise of the GSR or the USASR."
  britain.28.a:0 "A blow against Bolshevism in Britain!"
  britain.28.b:0 "This is a bit much..."

  britain.29.t:0 "Eric Blair is arrested!"
  britain.29.d:0 "After having left his London home, IL party leader Eric Blair was arrested by the local constabulary for supposed communist leanings. Blair had attended a party meeting the evening before and, according to reports, met with members of the British Communist Party. Blair’s deputy in the Independents, Annie Kenney, has denounced the claims and claimed the arrest was intended to discredit Blair. \n \n Already, the IL Party head has been brought before a sentencing hearing and is the first of likely many to be subject to the new Mental Hygiene Act. Under the provisions of the Act, Eric Blair will be placed in physiatric care until such time as his mental illness has been treated. Several other members of the Independents and the British Communist Party have also been arrested."

  britain.30.t:0 "The [GetYear] Suffrage Conference"
  britain.30.d:0 "Prime Minister Kenney’s continuing reforms have culminated in the [GetYear] Women’s Suffrage Conference in London. Convened by the PM herself, the Conference is intended to “create meaningful reform in regards to the place of women in Britain and the empire at large.” \n\n Among the many proposed ideas was the creation of a Women’s Auxillary Corps, or the WACs. The WAC would allow women within Britain to enlist in non-combat roles, such as engineers and medical personnel. Another proposed plan is the creation of the Imperial Women’s Air Academy. Planned to be based out of Manchester, the IWAA would be a supplementary element of the Royal Air Force, allowing selected female candidates to apply for air service. Such a programme would greatly boost our capacity to produce pilots. \n\n We don’t have enough political capital, or the budget, to approve both plans, so a choice must be made. One, the other, or neither?"

  britain.31.d:0 "With the passage of the Mental Hygiene Act not long ago, the Prime Minister and his cabinet have approached Parliament with a new proposal. The Un-British Activities Committee, or UBAC. The UBAC would be, essentially, an extra-judicial part of the British government, and would investigate government agencies in conjunction with the Imperial Intelligence Service and Scotland Yard. \n\n The opposition has called the plan “dangerously authoritarian”, with Clement Attlee of the Labour calling it the “least British thing” he’s ever heard. If allowed to go through, the UBAC would give Churchill and the Tories an unparalleled ability to blacklist individuals from government positions, a dangerous prospect given the PM’s harsh anti-leftist stance."
  britain.31.a:0 "Perhaps a more extensive investigation is necessary?"
  britain.31.b:0 "This is a bad idea."

  britain.32.t:0 "The UBAC is Blocked!"
  britain.32.d:0 "Churchill’s Proposal for the Un-British Activities Committee has been blocked! Elements of the coalition government have refused to back the plan, calling it a “threat to the stability of the nation.” The Prime Minister reportedly called those refusing to back the plan “cowards” and “bolshevik sympathizers” before storming out of parliament. \n\n With the UBAC Plan strangled in the crib, Labour leaders and socialists throughout the nation breathe a sigh of relief. For now."
  britain.32.a:0 "So close, yet so far."

  britain.33.t:0 "Investigating the Trade Union Council"
  britain.33.d:0 "The Trade Union Council is one of the largest union organizations in the United Kingdom. Working with unions from across the nation, they’ve coordinated strikes and sit-ins for years. Evidence has been discovered that members of the TUC may have affiliations with the British Communist party. \n\n Walter Citrine, speaking before the Committee this morning, denounced the claims of communist infiltration within the Council. Citrine’s words have fallen on deaf ears, as the evidence has clearly implicated many members of the TUC. As per the Mental Hygiene Act, Citrine, along with the majority of the TUC Council leadership, have been detained and remanded for psychiatric help."
  britain.33.a:0 "Communists! The whole lot of them!"

  britain.34.t:0 "Investigating Scotland Yard"
  britain.34.d:0 "Scotland Yard, the primary law enforcement agency in the Isles, has occasionally been accused of abuses or power, but never of communist sympathies. Regardless, the leadership of the police force has been brought before the Committee in regards to possible communist sympathies. \n\n Evidence discovered by our investigation indicates at least one member of the Scotland Yard leadership had a minor affiliation with the British Communist party by way of a divorced wife, but beyond that nothing substantial has been found. Regardless, we’ve asked that the rest of the police departments throughout the nation conduct similar investigations."
  britain.34.a:0 "All the more reason to put loyalists in charge."

  britain.35.t:0 "Investigating the Home Office - No Results"
  britain.35.d:0 "After an extensive review of the Home Office, including all personnel and leadership, we have determined that there are no notable members of the organization with ties to the British Communist Party. \n\n In light of our failed investigation, the Opposition has put forward that the Committee is simply conducting a witch hunt for political gain. While these accusations previously held no water, our failure in the crusade against Bolshevism has lead some even within our own party to think otherwise."
  britain.35.a:0 "Damn!"

  britain.36.d:0 "After an extensive review of the Home Office, including all personnel and leadership, we have found that many members of the organization have ties, tangential or otherwise, to the British Communist Party. In light of these discoveries, the Home Office has been subject to a much larger and extensive investigation to determine where their loyalties lie. Those found guilty of communist ties will be remanded for psychiatric care. \n\n Calls from the Opposition to end these “witch trials” have largely fell on deaf ears in light of the terrible discovery that’s been made."

  britain.37.t:0 "Investigating the Royal Navy - No Results"
  britain.37.d:0 "In a particularly risky move, we’ve conducted a full scale investigation of the Royal Navy and its associated departments, and have come up with nothing. The decision to investigate the Navy has proved particularly catastrophic for PM Churchill, whose previous associations with the department caused many to accuse him of being a turncoat. \n\n Sir James Somerville even went so far as to publicly shame Churchill during the hearings, reportedly asking “Have you no shame, sir?” Shortly after, Somerville stormed out of the interrogations, calling Churchill a variety of obscenities and denouncing him to the waiting press. Churchill’s days may very well be numbered..."

  britain.38.t:0 "Investigating the Royal Navy - Results"
  britain.38.d:0 "In a particularly risky move, we’ve conducted a full scale investigation of the Royal Navy and its associated departments, and have come up some disturbing results. It seems that at least a few notable members of the British naval leadership have ties, however tangential, to the British Communist Party. \n\n In light of this, members of the Royal Navy have either resigned or been remanded for mental health examination. With all barriers to the Committee’s investigations handled, they now have unrivaled power to persecute the communist threat throughout Britain."

  britain.39.t:0 "Winston Churchill Resigns"
  britain.39.d:0 "After the public relations nightmare that was the investigation of the Royal Navy, Sir Winston Churchill has elected to resign from his position as Prime Minister. The move, though shocking, was not unprepared for, and Lord Halifax has succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister and head of the government. \n\n Emboldened by the ailing Tories, the Labour opposition has already begun to tar the former Prime Minister as a traitor to the nation in a concerted smear campaign in the press. Churchill himself has made no statement, and has largely retired to his private residence. Many analysts believe that this likely marks the end of his political career. As the London Post put it “Not with a bang, but a whimper.”"

  britain.40.t:0 "Reducing the Military Budget"
  britain.40.d:0 "Since the end of the Great War, our military budget has been exponentially higher than many other postwar nations. This was largely due to the need for the Royal Navy to police our sea-based trade routes. Additionally, the British Expeditionary Force has been receiving large scale funding to better police the colonies and prevent uprisings. Both these situations have, in light of the recent economic crisis, proven unsustainable. \n\n In light of this, a proposal has been put before parliament to dramatically reduce funding for at least one agency of the British military, freeing up funds to better handle the economic crisis. If we defund any of these agencies, we are likely to receive considerable pushback from their leadership."

Such a government would bring in members from nearly every political party and department to cooperate for the common good. Several members of the current government have already put forward their candidacy to create this so-called “war cabinet.” \n\n There have been calls, however, for the military to step forward and assume direct control over the country. Such a move would be unprecedented in recent British history, but would give us an unparalleled amount of control over the government. Of course, getting the public to remain complicit in what is, essentially, a military junta, would be difficult. "

The most obvious group that fits this description is, of course, the British Imperial League. \n\n While Mitford hasn’t shown herself to be disloyal to his majesty’s government, she has proven rather disruptive to the political scene. A ban on the BIL has easily been voted through the Parliament, with only a few hardliners believing they should be allowed to operate. Lady Mitford naturally opposed the ban, but has since been arrested for “anti-war sympathies.” Without her leadership, the BIL has largely factionalized and broken up into smaller special interest parties."

During the Great War, one of the many promises we made, in exchange for support from the Jewish rebels in Ottoman Palestine, was to support the creation of a Jewish homeland. \n\n In the years since, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned and the Declaration gathered dust in the Home Office archives. Now, however, with the tides of the world changing, the idea of a Jewish homeland has become much more prominent. In particular, many so-called “Zionists” of the moderate and radical persuasion have been pushing the government to finally ratify the declaration. Ratifying it would lead into the creation of a Jewish state within the British Empire, while refusing to do so might anger radical Zionists into attempting to create a new state by force."

  britain.52.d:0 "The island of Ceylon, just off the Indian coast, has been in our possession since the early days of British rule in the subcontinent. After the Indian Revolution, it became our sole outpost in the region outside of British East India itself. In recent years, however, maintaining the island ourselves has proven something of a drain on resources. \n\n Perhaps we should transfer control of the island over to the British Raj in order to ease the burden?"

  britain.53.t:0 "London transfers Ceylon to us."

  britain.54.t:0 "The Commonwealth Standard"
  britain.54.d:0 "A natural issue that arose over time among the various British Dominions is that many are using different equipment. Whether this be rifles, munition caliber or the like, the issue has been a consistent complaint within the military for some time. \n\n A new plan, proposed by London, is the so-called “Commonwealth Standard Templates.” These designs, based on those tested and proven most efficient in the field, will be distributed out to all nations in the British Commonwealth. From rifles to helmets to rations, all Commonwealth nations will utilize the same standardized equipment, greatly streamlining production and reducing contract cost."
  britain.54.a:0 "An interesting proposal."

  britain.55.t:0 "Commonwealth Standard Rifles"
  britain.55.d:0 "Building upon the Commonwealth standardization programme, it has been proposed that all British Dominions adopt a single rifle design. Many of the Dominions have adopted variant or outright new designs, which while effective, can reduce the overall efficiency of a united British Army. \n\n To remedy this, all British Dominions will begin shifting towards a single unified rifle design, streamlining production and reducing overall costs."
  britain.55.a:0 "Excellent"

  britain.56.t:0 "The Indian National Congress"
  britain.56.d:0 "The situation in India has been a precarious one. The Indian Revolution in 1860 humiliated the British, and forced our control of the subcontinent back to Bengal and Burma. Despite repeated attempts by the Bihar Republic to liberate the territory, neither side has been able to make enough of a push to actually defeat the other. Since the end of the Great War, however, the situation has begun to change. \n\n In Bengal, there is an increasing resistance to British rule, owed largely to the poor treatment of the locals by the “Big Three” corporations that mostly control the colony. Among the most vocal of these is the “Tiger of Bengal” Chandras Bose. Bose and his small bandit army have been raising hell across the colony for years, assassinating officials and bombing vital infrastructure. \n\n A few different solutions exist. Cracking down on the radicals like Bose could lead to them gaining even further support. On the other hand, we could begin shifting towards Indian representation in the colony, with the ultimate goal of completely handing over administration to the Indians. The third option, of course, is to do nothing, make some token reforms, and hope for the best."

  britain.58.t:0 "The Future of British Africa"
  britain.58.d:0 "Out of all our colonies, the two that have been making the most noise recently are East Africa and Nigeria. Most particularly, there has been a strong developing Nigerian Independence movement that seeks to totally remove British influence from the nation. East Africa has experienced similar movements, and thanks to increasing African militancy, many of the attacks by these movements have become violent. \n\n In order to try and reduce African nationalist sentiment, it has been suggested that we establish East African and Nigerian protectorates. With increased representation within these Protectorates, African nationalist movements will likely lose steam and peter out over time."
  britain.58.a:0 "Establish Nigeria and East Africa as protectorates."

  britain.59.t:0 "The Tribal Protectorate Plan"
  britain.59.d:0 "Building on our reforms of the African colonies, we should begin establishing smaller Tribal protectorates within our African colonies. These protectorates would ensure that the tribes are protected from conflict between one another and outside forces, while having their leadership swear loyalty to the British crown. \n\n We have already seen limited success with similar programs in South Africa and beyond, ergo expanding the policy would further decrease Anglo-African tensions."

  britain.60.t:0 "The [GetYear] Dublin Re-Negotiations"
  britain.60.d:0 "The 1916 Dublin Treaty was a treaty established between moderate factions of the IRA and the British crown, creating an Irish parliament while retaining Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. While this curbed Irish nationalism at first, the economic downturn hit Ireland particularly hard, and a perceived inability of the British to handle the issue has sparked an increase in Anglo-Irish tensions. \n\n Bringing together representatives of the moderate IRA factions and notable Irish politicians, we have convened a conference in London to re-negotiate the terms of the agreement. The easiest solution would obviously be to grant full Irish independence, though this would severely damage our administration’s credibility. On the other hand, a compromise could be reached to give the Irish autonomy as a dominion. This would grant them a new Irish parliament and independence in all but foreign policy and would help to greatly curb Irish nationalism."

The National Recovery Act has been proposed, intending to establish a comprehensive series of reforms and jobs programs to help jumpstart the economy again. The act is controversial, with influence from Mosley’s self sufficiency plan being a major point of contention with the hardline conservatives. \n\n Passing the act will require considerable political support, and if it fails, might prove catastrophic for both the economy and British politics."

  britain.64.t:0 "Whispers of Conspiracy"
  britain.64.d:0 "Since the failure of the Recovery Act, there have been rumors of conspiracy within the British military. According to these rumors, the so-called “Harris Clique”, headed by Air marshall Arthur Harris, has begun plans for the removal of parliament. This has been revealed by an anonymous investigative report, naming at least a dozen major military officials and over a hundred officers in the supposed plot. \n\n The plot could just be nonsense, but if not, it could be a grave threat to British democracy is allowed to proceed unimpeded."

  britain.65.t:0 "The King's Speech"
  britain.65.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, elements of the so-called “Harris Clique” stormed Parliament this morning and took much of Britain’s ruling body hostage. The true intent of the coup was discovered when King-Emperor Edward spoke before Parliament this afternoon. Claiming that they had failed the nation by not passing the Recovery Act, the King stated that parliament was to be dissolved immediately and that the Harris Clique junta will be taking provisional control of the government. \n\n Speaking over the radio shortly after, the King-Emperor addressed the nation. “The failure of our democratic institution, of the talking shop at Westminster, has compelled myself and the military to assume direct control of the British government. The starving people of Britain demand great change and at great speed, and we shall deliver both. Britain shall return to greatness, and shall remain a safe and secure society.” \n\n Most shockingly, some have even welcomed the Royal coup, pledging their support to the new Imperial regime. On the other hand, fearing that the swift hand of the King-Emperor may come down upon them, a mass exodus of leftists has already begun to places unknown."
  britain.65.a:0 "I am the Parliament."

  britain.66.t:0 "The King enforces the Recovery Act"
  britain.66.d:0 "Alongside a series of sweeping reforms, the King-Emperor has passed a modified version of the National Recovery act. Renamed to the “Imperial Recovery Act”, the programme is already seeing success throughout Britain, with early estimates indicating a drastic reduction in poverty and unemployment thanks to massive public works spending. \n\n The move has earned the new government considerable praise, though some voices still call for a return to normalcy and the end of the reactionary junta."
  britain.66.a:0 "All hail!"

  britain.67.t:0 "The Future of Great Britain"
  britain.67.d:0 "With the King at the helm of power under the Harris Clique, it has been proposed that the Junta move from it’s initial provisional concept towards the institution of an absolute monarchy. The pro-absolutist faction of the Junta, Claude Auchinleck, has pushed to establish a new absolutist hereditary monarchy. Auchinleck believes that an absolute monarchy might be easier for the people to stomach, and proposed a system of managed democracy that allows for minimal democracy while maintaining the real power in the king. \n\n Alternatively, some have proposed inviting the increasingly popular Diana Mitford into the government. Mitford’s ultranationalist ideas have found some support within the British aristocracy and public, ergo bringing her on as a direct advisor to the King could help to ease tensions with the public. With Mitford as a puppet to the King’s will, surely nothing can go wrong."

Such a maneuver is largely unprecedented in recent British history, and has drawn some ire from the small but vocal British republicans. The King went so far as to outright threaten the Prime Minister that if the act did not pass, that he would ensure that his days were numbered in government. \n\n Unsurprisingly, the Prime Minister has bent to the King’s demands and returned to the Coalition government to pass the act without incident. Though the vital recovery act has been passed today, concerns still abound that the King may have gone too far in his efforts."

Additionally, large “ethnic resettlement centers” would be established in the countryside to house these individuals until they can be “dealt with” \n\n This process would naturally be monstrously unpopular, but would provide an easy avenue to deal with political enemies.

Anarchy reigns in the streets of the United Kingdom, as both Mitfordites, civilians and royalists battle it out for control of cities. \n\n In order to maintain control, Mitford has ordered that all elements of the Blackshirts be mobilized to gain control over as much territory as possible. With limited forces available, the regime can only focus on securing vital regions. Maintaining control of the United Kingdom’s constituencies may be less important, as failing to maintain control of England proper may give the royalists and resistance enough power to overthrow the government.

  britain_external.1.t:0 "Raid on Larkin IRA Safehouse"
  britain_external.1.d:0 "A small task force of the Home Guard and the local police have stormed and seized a safehouse in Northern Ireland belonging to the Larkin faction of the IRA. A large number of rifles and improvised explosives have been seized and logged. Two members of the Larkin IRA were killed in the raid, while the rest have been arrested and sent for arrest and sentencing. Evidence of Larkin’s location was not found."
  britain_external.1.a:0 "We'll root these reds out for sure!"

  britain_external.2.t:0 "Raid on O'Duffy IRA Safehouse"
  britain_external.2.d:0 "Working off of tips provided by local authorities, police and the Home Guard were able to launch a successful raid on an O’Duffy aligned IRA safehouse on the outskirts of Dublin. Several men were killed in the small firefight, however a dearth of evidence and illegal weaponry will allow us to easily convict those arrested. Evidence of O’duffy’s location remains elusive, though some investigators have noticed that the IRA members were using weapons of German and Austrian manufacture."
  britain_external.2.a:0 "We'll whip the Browns right back to Vienna!"

  britain_external.3.t:0 "Nationwide Roundup against the O'Duffy IRA"
  britain_external.3.d:0 "Using evidence recovered from the raid on the O’Duffy IRA Safehouse, we’ve been able to conduct a full-scale nationwide crackdown on those implicated in the papers. Several members of moderate IRA factions and even associates of the Dublin parliament have been implicated and arrested in the roundup. We have severely damaged the operational capacity of the O’Duffy IRA faction."
  britain_external.3.a:0 "Nice job, lads."

  britain_external.4.t:0 "Ban instituted on Irish Trade Unions"
  britain_external.4.d:0 "Working with authorities in Ireland, we have shut down many major Irish trade unions, who have been a major source of public support for James Larkin’s offshoot of the IRA. Trade Unions in Ireland in general have been banned outright, though it is believed that many are still operating underground. We have yet to locate any major individuals within the Larkin IRA Faction, however."
  britain_external.4.a:0 "We'll cleanse these isles of red terror yet!"

  britain_external.5.t:0 "The Imperial Investment Plan"
  britain_external.5.d:0 "We have received investments from the United Kingdom’s new Imperial Investment Plan, which will greatly assist our ability to provide loans and increase our factory production capacity. "
  britain_external.5.a:0 "An excellent idea!"

  britain_external.6.t:0 "The Colonial Literacy Campaign"
  britain_external.6.d:0 "As part of a programme instituted by Prime Minister Blair, all colonies are to receive funding for large-scale literacy campaigns. These campaigns, working to combat mass illiteracy in many of the more remote colonies, could prove to be a major boon for our nation."
  britain_external.6.a:0 "A wonderful proposal!"

  britain_external.7.t:0 "Purging the Irish Parliament"
  britain_external.7.d:0 "The Irish Parliament, established after the Easter Rising to provide a facade of Irish Home Rule, has long been a holdout of IRA supporters. In particular, those that support Larkin’s faction, largely of the Irish Labour Party, have come to dominate it. In order to curb mainstream IRA influence, we’ve had the majority of the Irish Parliament removed and replaced with loyalists. \n\n Though the move will garner us little sympathy from the Irish public, it should nonetheless prevent Larkin from gaining further influence within the government."
  britain_external.7.a:0 "Hopefully that should sort them out."

  britain_external.8.t:0 "Successful Safehouse Raid"
  britain_external.8.d:0 "Authorities in Ireland have successfully conducted raids against safehouses aligned to the O’duffy Faction of the Irish Republican Army. Via these raids, we have secured not only weapons and bomb-making materials, but also vital intelligence on the location of the faction leader, Eoin O’Duffy."
  britain_external.8.a:0 "Now, we can end this."

  britain_external.9.t:0 "Failed Safehouse Raid"
  britain_external.9.d:0 "Authorities in Ireland conducted a series of raids on safehouses in areas noted to be supportive of the O’Duffy faction. However, these raids ultimately came up with nothing, as the safehouses had either been evacuated previously or were false leads. The hunt for O’Duffy continues."
  britain_external.9.a:0 "We'll get them next time."

  britain_external.10.t:0 "Eoin O'Duffy Assassinated"
  britain_external.10.d:0 "Acting on information acquired during safehouse raids in Ireland, authorities were able to locate Eoin O’Duffy and several notable members of the Ultranationalist IRA. Located in a compound in the Ulster countryside, the IRA leadership had heavily fortified their position. The Home Guard, requisitioned from Great Britain, stormed the compound in a brutal night raid. \n\n Fierce fighting ensued, with heavy casualties on both sides. Ultimately, however, much of the IRA leadership was either captured or killed during the raid. Among those killed was Eoin himself, who was reportedly shot in the back while fleeing the scene. With his death, and the capture of most of the Ultranationalist IRA, their faction has quickly splintered and disbanded."

  britain_external.13.t:0 "James Larkin Assassinated"
  britain_external.13.d:0 "Using the information obtained from raids on Larkin-aligned IRA safehouses, we’ve been able to locate James Larkin’s personal safehouse in Dublin. The safehouse, disguised as a warehouse, the building was stormed by the Home Guard and local police. After an intense firefight, Larkin was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Evidence located at the scene will be more than enough to send those arrested to court. With their leadership decapitated, the Communist faction of the IRA has already begun to disband or even factionalize."
  britain_external.13.a:0 "The Communist IRA has been defeated"

  britain_external.14.t:0 "The Irish Revolution!"
  britain_external.14.d:0 "Sparked by the killing of Eoin O’Duffy, James Larkin and the Communist faction of the IRA have seized control over the capital in Dublin. With unprecedented public support, Larkin’s militias were swelled by elements of the local constabulary and armed civilians. From the steps of the capital building, Larkin declared the “Irish Democratic Republic” and that “the Irish people refuse to take part in the tyrannical, murderous, imperialist regime in London.” \n\n The garrisons of the Home Guard are already being besieged by riots and gunfire. For the second time in a century, the rebellious nature of the Irish people has fermented to the surface. The Irish Revolution has begun..."

  britain_external.15.t:0 "The Irish Revolution"
  britain_external.15.d:0 "With the death of James Larkin, Eoin O’Duffy of the Ultranationalist IRA has staged a revolution in Dublin! Storming the Irish Parliament building with a horde of Blueshits, O’Duffy formally declared the “Irish Free State.” Calling Britain a “tyrannical, murderous power bent on Irish destruction”, O’Duffy has rallied the entire South of Ireland against the Dublin government. Supporters of O’Duffy’s regime have already begun to come out of the woodwork, attacking local garrisons with anything available. \n\n With our forces in Ireland under constant attack and Irish reprisals against Englishmen running rampant, it seems that what started as a minor uptick in attacks has gotten massively out of control."
  britain_external.15.a:0 "It's treason, then."
  britain_external.15.b:0 "Play as §Y Ireland §!"

  britain_external.16.t:0 "The Ulster Negotiations"
  britain_external.16.d:0 "The sudden revolt in Southern Ireland was not entirely unexpected. What was unexpected was the sheer amount of public support it has garnered from the Irish populace. In Ulster, several members of the former Irish parliament have approached us suggesting that we seek negotiations with the new Irish government. Liam Lynch, a former parliament leader, suggested that “putting down this rebellion may require a level of bloodshed that the British people may refuse to support it.”\n\n While negotiations with the Irish would gain us little fanfare at home, it would allow us to prevent any further bloodshed than has already occurred."
  britain_external.16.a:0 "Ireland is part of the Empire. No appeasement."
  britain_external.16.b:0 "We should avoid bloodshed."

  britain_external.17.t:0 "Britain offers Negotiations"
  britain_external.17.d:0 "The British government has offered to negotiate with the new Dublin regime. The ball is in our court, so to speak, to make an offer. Hardliners believe we should ignore negotiations entirely, while more pragmatic cabinet members believe we should see what the British are willing to take."
  britain_external.17.a:0 "Negotiate? In our hour of triumph?"
  britain_external.17.b:0 "Seek Independece for Ireland, sans Ulster"
  britain_external.17.c:0 "Seek Independence for all Irishmen!"

  britain_external.18.t:0 "Ireland's Response"
  britain_external.18.d:0 "The Irish government has returned with a request. They request independence for all of Ireland, sans Ulster. With Ulster predominantly populated by loyalists, holding it would be easier than trying to reconquer the rest of Ireland. \n\n How should we proceed?"
  britain_external.18.a:0 "Fair enough."
  britain_external.18.b:0 "We'd rather die!"

  britain_external.22.t:0 "The First Conference for the Imperial Federation"
  britain_external.22.d:0 "Today marks the first conference for the creation of the British Imperial Federation, and the first order of business is deciding what kind of federation should be formed. Two primary proposals have been put forward. The first favors the complete centralization of the Empire around a single, united Imperial Parliament. Under this system, Britain would unite into one state with her North American dominions, establishing a united parliament centered out of London. \n\n The other proposal favors a policy of federalization, which would lead to all nations becoming equal members of the Empire. This policy would end the Dominion system permanently, and is much more favored by nations within the Empire that wish to retain their autonomy should the Federation be voted in."
  britain_external.22.a:0 "Pursue a policy of Centralization"
  britain_external.22.b:0 "Pursue a policy of Confederation"

  britain_external.23.t:0 "The First Conference of the Imperial Federation"
  britain_external.23.d:0 "With the initial planning process of the Imperial Federation complete, delegates from throughout the Empire have assembled in London. Each Dominion will be voting whether or not to formalize the union. \n\n Each dominion will cast one vote, either for or against the plan. If the plan is voted into action, we can begin the process of either forming the Imperial Federation or Confederation depending on our prior decisions. The future of the Empire is on the line this evening. Let’s hope this opportunity doesn’t go to waste."
  britain_external.23.a:0 "The Voting begins."

  britain_external.24.t:0 "Voting on the British Imperial Federation"
  britain_external.24.d:0 "Voting has begun on the plans for the British Imperial Federation. We must decide whether to vote for, or against the proposed plan."
  britain_external.24.a:0 "Vote §Y FOR §! Centralization"

  britain_external.25.a:0 "We can now pursue a plan for §Y Centralization §!"
  britain_external.25.b:0 "We can now pursue a plan for §Y Confederation §!"

  britain_external.26.t:0 "Failed Vote"
  britain_external.26.d:0 "The vote on the creation of the British Imperial Federation has been struck down. Attlee’s grand project has been a miserable failure, and is likely to be confined to the dustbin of history. \n\n We can now no longer pursue the creation of the Federation."
  britain_external.26.a:0 "How unfortunate."

  britain_external.27.t:0 "Instituting the Centralization Plan"
  britain_external.27.d:0 "With a successful vote at the Imperial Conference, we can now begin instituting our plan for centralization. Under this program, the Dominions of Canada and America will unite with Great Britain to form a single Anglo and Anglo-American superstate. \n\n All that is required now is to formalize the plan with our dominions."
  britain_external.27.a:0 "Truly a momentous occasion."

  britain_external.28.t:0 "Formalizing the Imperial Centralization Plan"
  britain_external.28.d:0 "With the Imperial Federation Centralization plan voted into action by the Imperial Parliament, we are obligated to turn over administration to the Imperial authorities."
  britain_external.28.a:0 "We shall formalize the plan."
  britain_external.28.b:0 "No thanks."

  britain_external.29.t:0 "The British Imperial Federation"
  britain_external.29.d:0 "The British Imperial Federation has been completed at last. Centralized around a united Parliament in London, the predominantly Anglo and Anglo American Dominions have united into a single Anglo superstate. Presiding over the historic ceremony, the King declared today “Unity Day”, in honor of the unification of our peoples. \n\n With the dominions united, the Anglo dominant regions of the Empire have at last united officially with their mother country. Today, citizens across the Empire can look forwards towards a new, brighter future. "
  britain_external.29.a:0 "For King and Country!"

  britain_external.30.t:0 "The British Imperial Confederation"
  britain_external.30.d:0 "Today marks the completion of the British Imperial Confederation. By far, one of the most ambitious programmes ever attempted by the Empire, the Confederation sought to ensure all nations were equal under the crown. Today, that goal has finally been achieved. \n\n Announcing the completion of the programme in London, the King officially declared the Confederation alongside delegates from every single dominion. Under this new system, all Dominions will function on equal footing with one another politically, rather than as extensions of London. Via a new Imperial Parliament, the dominions can cooperate for the mutual good of each other and the Empire, while still remaining nominally under the British crown. \n\n While not as dramatic as a more centralized union, the Confederation is still one of the most revolutionary moves in recent British imperial policy, and it remains to be seen how it will survive, or if it even will."
  britain_external.30.a:0 "An Empire, united at long last."

  britain_external.31.t:0 "The Future of the Victoria Canal"
  britain_external.31.d:0 "The Victoria Canal in Panama is a major shipping and economic asset to the British Empire, though we have faced some issues with the United Provinces and Gran Colombia, both of which have sought control over the canal. It has been proposed that we turn over the canal to the United Provinces in exchange for a formal diplomatic alliance."
  britain_external.31.a:0 "Offer direct control in exchange for an alliance."
  britain_external.31.b:0 "The canal belongs to Britain."

  britain_external.32.t:0 "Abandoning Ireland?"
  britain_external.32.d:0 "The Irish revolutionaries have managed to secure the entirety of Ireland, and now occupy nearly every town and city on the small island. Reclaiming the island in light of this might require an investment that neither our government or the British people are willing to make. \n\n Quite frankly, it has been suggested that we abandon our ambitions on retaining Ireland and focus on other affairs."
  britain_external.32.a:0 "Give them what they want. They're not worth the trouble."
  britain_external.32.b:0 "Ireland is rightfully English!"

  britain_external.33.t:0 "The British abandon Ireland"
  britain_external.33.d:0 "Having been pushed out of Ireland entirely, the British have simply abandoned the island to our regime. At long last, after more than a century of British domination, Ireland is at last independent from the British Empire. Now, we must look inwards to bring Ireland to the greatness it so rightly deserves."

  britain_external.37.d:0 "The North Sea is a region vitally important to trade in and out of the Baltic Sea. Right now, the region is largely monitored by individual nations, but if we were to pool our resources, the various nations bordering the North Sea could more effectively patrol the area and protect martime trade during war. Perhaps we should pursue this venture, and work more closely with the Nordic nations and Dutch?"

  britainflavour.3.d:0 "Howard Carter, famed Egyptologist and well known for his discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun, has approached the Imperial Administration requesting funding for an expedition into the Egyptian desert. Carter claims to have discovered a series of stone structures deep in the Saharan desert, far beyond any previously noted Egyptian settlements. \n\n The man believes that these structures could indicate anything from a lost Saharan civilization to even larger Egyptian expansionism. In the event of either, Carter believes that with funding from the Imperial authorities, he can begin a full investigation."
  britainflavour.3.a:0 "Provide him his funding."
  britainflavour.3.b:0 "We have no interest in crank theories."

  britainflavour.4.t:0 "Carter Reports In"
  britainflavour.4.d:0 "Carter has reported in to the Imperial authorities from the dig site. Working with the locals and a token force of British colonial constabulary, he has begun to make headway on the ruins. Despite sweltering heat and sandstorms, the expedition has reportedly made considerable progress. \n\n Carter reports that the ruins resemble none ever seen in the upper Nile, and that they couldn’t possibly be of Egyptian construction. The ruins, largely consisting of unearthed carved columns and a still unopened temple, are “of a queer, strangely alien appearance.” He goes on to mention that their geometry appears strange at night, and that many of the local workers have been spooked off the dig site out of some misguided superstition. Carter reports that the tomb complex proper should be broken into relatively soon, and that he will report his findings post-haste."
  britainflavour.4.a:0 "We wish him the best of luck."

  britainflavour.5.t:0 "Colonial Patrols locate Expedition"
  britainflavour.5.d:0 "After hearing nothing from Carter for more than a month, officials in Egypt-Sudan have been dispatched to investigate the dig site. What they have discovered is puzzling. The officials report that the site is abandoned, and that there appeared to be no signs of any human habitation for more than a week. Carter himself could not be located, nor could any of the guards dispatched along with him. \n\n Food appears to have been prepared and left out uneaten, and several tents had burnt down, likely due to unattended lamplights. The only evidence that could be located were a set of footprints leading into the temple complex, which had been collapsed by an explosive charge. Only a few notes could be recovered from Carter’s journals, which had been filled with weeks worth of incoherent scribbling. No remains could be located, and the site was abandoned shortly after the investigation concluded."
  britainflavour.5.a:0 "How strange."

  britainflavour.6.t:0 "Expedition reports No Results"
  britainflavour.6.d:0 "Carter’s Expedition has reported back, stating that no results could be found. Having intensively studied the site, they concluded that the site holds no real value. Attempts to enter the temple complex proved fruitless, as several dynamite explosions were unable to piece the thick stone door. Only a small hole could be opened, through which Carter reportedly looked through to see inside. The exact details of what happened following that are vague, but the Imperial officers sent with the expedition report that Carter began screaming incoherently for several days without stopping. \n\n Attempts to console the man proved fruitless, and the hole into the complex was closed as quickly as it was opened. Carter died two days after the incident, supposedly from a previously undiagnosed heart condition. The expedition has been ended, and those involved either returned to their families or  remanded to Imperial intelligence."
  britainflavour.6.a:0 "What a shame."

  britainflavour.7.t:0 "Expedition reports Results"
  britainflavour.7.d:0 "Carter’s Expedition has reported back, and with dramatic results. Carter has returned with a variety of artifacts and notes on the temple complex and ruins surrounding it. His extensive notes document an apparently hitherto unknown civilization in the saharan region of non-human origin. Carter himself claims that after breaching the temple complex, the expedition simultaneously experienced a sudden lapse in memory. \n\n After this occurred, Carter explains that he awoke in his tent, surrounded by hundreds of notes that he didn’t remember writing. These notes extensively described advanced mathematical formulas for “trans-planetary travel” and several rituals that our investigators are unwilling to explain in detail. Carter, despite his age, seemed greatly invigorated by the expedition, and has since apparently vanished to “investigate further.” Those familiar with Carter stated that he seemed like a “different man” when he returned. Despite the oddity of the situation, Carter’s notes could prove useful for our research. Perhaps we could study them more extensively?"
  britainflavour.7.a:0 "Perhaps these can be put to use?"
  britainflavour.7.b:0 "They belong in a museum!"

  britainflavour.8.t:0 "The Crystal Palace Fire"
  britainflavour.8.d:0 "The Crystal Palace, built for the 1851 London World’s Fair, burnt down last night in catastrophic fashion. A monument to the capability of Victorian-Era architecture, the Palace had fallen into disuse over recent years and had largely functioned as a concert hall for London aristocracy. \n\n The destruction of the Palace has sparked a small controversy over what to do with what remains. Albert Speer, a prominent member of the London German Emigres, has proposed plans for the “New Imperial Palace” complex. Speer’s notability has come from his proposed “New London” plan, which would see vast swathes of the British capital re-designed in a harsh, yet modern Brutalist style. Speer’s proposed Imperial Palace would be a vast complex of structures, built in the center of Hyde Park in dramatic style as a representation of British imperial power. Expensive, perhaps, but a tempting plan."
  britainflavour.8.a:0 "Provide reconstruction funding"
  britainflavour.8.b:0 "Demolish the ruins and move on."

  britainflavour.9.t:0 "The 1936 Empire Games"
  britainflavour.9.d:0 "Opening in London this week are the 1936 Commonwealth Games. Hosted by Britain this year, the Commonwealth games have been a regular occasion throughout the Empire since their creation in the late 1800s. Among those competing are Anglo-American upstarts Decima Norman of New England and Olympic hopeful Jesse Owens of the Great Lakes. The games have become notable in recent years for the deep rivalry between the national football teams of the Great Lakes and New England, which seems like it will finally come to a head."
  britainflavour.9.a:0 "How exciting!"

  britainflavour.10.t:0 "Sir Henry Dale wins the Nobel Prize"
  britainflavour.10.d:0 "Sir Henry Hallett Dale, a notable pharmacologist from Islington, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in a lavish London ceremony this evening. Dale’s work on the use of acetylcholine and the nervous system has lead to numerous breakthroughs in the common understanding of synapses. Dale’s Nobel Prize is yet another example of British exceptionalism, and he is anticipated to be received by the King-Emperor himself at Buckingham Palace."
  britainflavour.10.a:0 "Another great achievement for the Empire!"

  britainflavour.11.t:0 "The Jazz Craze hits London"
  britainflavour.11.d:0 "Though already firmly entrenched in the Americas, Jazz music has been slow to catch on in the isles in recent years. Often disregarded by the upper crust of British society, a steady increase in the genre’s popularity has been seen throughout much of the lower and middle class throughout the nation. \n\n The trend has been most evident in the British youth, who have become infected with a sort of “Jazz-mania” in recent months thanks to a network of unscrupulous record sellers. Moral authorities rail against the supposed “uncivilized” influences of the genre, but the movement shows little sign of stopping."
  britainflavour.11.a:0 "Kids these days."

  britainflavour.12.t:0 "Tensions in the German Community"
  britainflavour.12.d:0 "After the outbreak of the Weimar Civil War, thousands of German intellectuals, scientists and politicians fled the ailing country to seek asylum abroad. The vast majority of these individuals ended up in Britain, largely due to intense anti-German sentiment throughout France and the Low Countries. The majority of the emigre population was settled in East Anglia, though similar German communities are scattered throughout Southern England. Tensions between the locals and the Emigres have always been high, but recent days have seen a massive uptick in anti-German violence. \n\n The worst incidences have broken out in East Anglia, where a demonstration by the Far-Right “People’s Veteran’s League” lead to violence against local German businesses. Though police were quick to intervene, at least a dozen people were grievously injured and thousands in damages incurred."
  britainflavour.12.a:0 "Stuff breaks, people die."

  lore.4.t:0 "Great Britain \n Standing Astride the World"
  lore.4.d:0 "It is arguable that the British Empire is one of the greatest Empires in human history. Controlling vast territories the world over, on every continent and subcontinent, maintained through one of the largest navies fielded in history. From their comparably tiny island, the British have been able to conquer the world in everything but the literal sense. The Golden Age of the British Empire is often marked by historians as the end of the Washington Rebellion in the 1700s, which lead directly to the development of the so-called British System. Through this, Britain granted their colonies a greater degree of autonomy and in exchange, those colonies would swear their loyalty to the British crown. Not even the loss of Western India to revolution could stop the meteoric rise of the Anglo hegemony. \n \n In 1914, all of this came to a crashing halt. Forced into conflict with the German Empire and the Central Powers, Britain forged an alliance of convenience with the continental powers of France and Russia. The Great War would prove the costliest conflict in human history, with millions dead and whole nations wiped off the map. In the years since the war, Britain has retreated to the home isles once more, content to manage the empire in isolation from European problems. Even there, problems abound for London. Rising nationalism and the spread of communist movements have begun to undermine their most vulnerable colonies, and it seems the whole of the Americas is poised to explode into general war once more. Britainnia may rule the waves today, but that may not be the case tomorrow. The Pax Britannica seems about to come to a catastrophic end."
