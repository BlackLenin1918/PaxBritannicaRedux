  PB_ENG_Postwar_Pacifism:0 "Postwar Pacifism"
  PB_ENG_Postwar_Pacifism_desc:0 "Britain's victory in the Great War was extracted at the cost of an entire generation. Millions died in the trenches across Europe, from Iberia to Normandy, and those who survived now hold sway over the political establishment. The people demand that Britain never again allow such a tragedy to occur, but with rising militarism across the continent, it may be necessary to re-energize the nation's martial spirit once more."
  PB_ENG_Economic_Stagnation:0 "Economic Stagnation"
  PB_ENG_Economic_Stagnation_desc:0 "Great Britain’s economy has been suffering a state of stagnation since the Great War, with inter-empire trade not fostering the same growth it used to. The growth of investment bubbles has lead to an incredibly unstable economic situation, with some even predicting an outright collapse."
  PB_ENG_Overconfident_Staff:0 "Overconfident General Staff"
  PB_ENG_Overconfident_Staff_desc:0 "Britain’s military has become increasingly edified in their doctrines and standards, leading to a military uninterested in reform."
  PB_ENG_Imperial_Confederation_Head:0 "Head of the §YBritish Imperial Confederation§!"
  PB_ENG_Imperial_Confederation_Head_desc:0 "The United Kingdom is the current center of the British Imperial Confederation. The Imperial Parliament, located in London, is attended by all Constituent Commonwealths and Dominions of the British Empire. All Commonwealth nations are granted the right to elect Ministers of Imperial Parliament (MIPs) to represent them in inter-empire affairs. Though once a shining example of imperial cooperation, the Confederation has become increasingly ineffective at actually rectifying the Empire's myriad of problems. \n\n Hampered by bureacracy and the increasing assertiveness of the American Commonwealth, the Confederation is seen by many as an archaic relic of 19th century imperial policy."
