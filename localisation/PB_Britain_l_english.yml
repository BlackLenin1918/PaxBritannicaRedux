  PB_ENG_Postwar_Pacifism:0 "Postwar Pacifism"
  PB_ENG_Postwar_Pacifism_desc:0 "Britain's victory in the Great War was extracted at the cost of an entire generation. Millions died in the trenches across Europe, from Iberia to Normandy, and those who survived now hold sway over the political establishment. The people demand that Britain never again allow such a tragedy to occur, but with rising militarism across the continent, it may be necessary to re-energize the nation's martial spirit once more."
  PB_ENG_Economic_Stagnation:0 "Economic Stagnation"
  PB_ENG_Economic_Stagnation_desc:0 "Great Britain’s economy has been suffering a state of stagnation since the Great War, with inter-empire trade not fostering the same growth it used to. The growth of investment bubbles has lead to an incredibly unstable economic situation, with some even predicting an outright collapse."
  PB_ENG_Overconfident_Staff:0 "Overconfident General Staff"
  PB_ENG_Overconfident_Staff_desc:0 "Britain’s military has become increasingly edified in their doctrines and standards, leading to a military uninterested in reform."

  PB_ENG_Imperial_Confederation_Head_desc:0 "The United Kingdom is the current center of the British Imperial Confederation. The Imperial Parliament, located in London, is attended by all Constituent Commonwealths and Dominions of the British Empire. All Commonwealth nations are granted the right to elect Ministers of Imperial Parliament (MIPs) to represent them in inter-empire affairs. Though once a shining example of imperial cooperation, the Confederation has become increasingly ineffective at actually rectifying the Empire's myriad of problems. \n\n Hampered by bureacracy and the increasing assertiveness of the American Commonwealth, the Confederation is seen by many as an archaic relic of 19th century imperial policy."

Opposing him is Oswald Mosley, the so-called Red Right Hand of moderate ideologue Clement Attlee. Mosley's platform is far more moderate, believing that Britain requires results rather than revolution, and his alliance with Attlee is how he intends to accomplish this."

Of particular concern is the brutality of the attack, with many of those killed having been hacked to death with improvised bladed weapons.\n\nMore problematic is that since these reports were filed, at least four other similar attacks have occurred. Some of the soldiers have cheekily referred to the incidents as the 'Machete Rebellion'. Though it has not reached the point of a full scale uprising, the tension between the locals and the settlers is palpable, even in major cities.

  britain.61.d:0 "With Denmark under occupation by the French, their overseas possessions are in a state of limbo. The Danish royal family remains in exile, and there is a concern among the military leadership that the overseas provinces may choose to join the French collaborator regime, potentially giving France greater access to the Atlantic. This is a situation that we cannot allow to happen.\n\nBacked by the Royal Navy, Imperial Marines landed on the shores of the Faroe Islands and Iceland during the night. Caught off guard, the small Danish garrisons, already demoralized by news of Copenhagen's defeat, were quickly disarmed. Though clearly not pleased with the turn of events, there was little that the Danes could do to prevent the occupation. As of this morning, reports indicate that we now have full control over the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland. Any pro-French elements of the local populations have been arrested by IIS agents and remanded to POW facilities in Scotland for interrogation."

  britain.62.t:0 "The Future of Iceland"
  britain.62.d:0 "Iceland, while autonomous under the Danish, now lies under the control of the British Empire. Despite this, the Icelandic Althing has continued operating as though the occupation were not happening at all. In fact, many of Iceland's politicians have been pushing for an open declaration of independence from Denmark. Sveinn Björnsson, a vocal critic of the occupation, declared to crowds in Reykjavík that Iceland would seek full patriation from Denmark. All this talk of independence has begun to make the occupation authorities uneasy. The last thing we need is insurrection on an island as inhospitable as Iceland.\n\nFrom this unease has come a handful of proposals to London on how best to resolve the Icelandic dissent. The most obvious solution is to simply end the occupation, granting Iceland independence in exchange for remaining in the Imperial Powers until the war is finished. A more radical solution, popular among British warhawks, is to pressure the Althing into accepting a constitutional monarchy and commonwealth status under the British Empire. Such a move would be an outrage to the Danes, but as it stands right now they aren't in much of a position to do more than protest. Simply remaining on the island and continuing the occupation would be deeply unpopular with both the Icelandic people and our own, as well as a drain on our resources, but it would ensure we have the most control over Reykjavík's ports."

  britain.1011.d:0 "Gallacher's election to the Prime Ministership has caused a not inconsiderable rift within the Worker's Union Party between the radicals and the reformists. The decidedly anarchist direction which Gallacher's cabinet has taken the party has caused the reformist faction, headed by Mosley and Attlee, to become disillusioned with the WUP. They continually fight against the most important reforms of Gallacher's platform, and party infighting makes it difficult to use our parliamentary support to our advantage.\n\nIn light of this, Gallacher has assembled a coalition of the radical party heads from throughout the WUP and proposed an alliance with the United Republican Front. A fringe Jacobin faction, the URF has remained a vocal but largely powerless left wing faction in Britain for some time. Gallacher believes that aligning with the URF and rallying his supporters in the United Trade Unions will give him the political support to oust Mosley and Attlee from their positions of authority in the WUP. The move would be extremely risky, as the reformists make up a not inconsiderable portion of the party leadership. Disempowering them could potentially handicap the WUP or even split the party, even if it would give us a freer hand in passing legislation."

Claiming that Gallacher has hijacked the party with his radical anarchist ideals, Mosley and Attlee have left the WUP and taken a significant portion of the party with them, accounting for a considerable portion of the party's reformist branch.\n\nThe two have even gone so far as to found a new political party, calling themselves the \"Labour Party\" and drawing the support of many of the WUP's disillusioned moderates. This has been a catastrophe for our parliamentary support, but thankfully the support of the UTU and the radicals has become even stronger. The WUP is badly wounded, but Prime Minister Gallacher has reaffirmed his stance that the party shall carry on the socialist struggle with or without the moderates."

This comes to light at the worst possible time for Mosley's new cabinet, and particularly for the WUP which has enjoyed the support of Britain's Jewish communities.\n\nCoupled with Mosley's prior controversies, many in the party are now calling for his removal in favor of someone less problematic. The most natural transition is for Clement Attlee, generally seen as the brains behind Mosley's populist agenda, to assume the Prime Ministership. Other factions are at work, however, and the radicals within the WUP have pushed for Maraget Bondfield to assume the Prime Ministership should Mosley be pressured to resign. Seen as a compromise leader, Bondfield's status as both a trade unionist and suffragette would win the Moderates the support of the radicals without giving into their demands too much.\n\nOf course, there is the possibility of allowing Mosley to remain in power, however doing so would give the perception that the party is unwilling to combat bigotry in their ranks."

  britain.2000.t:0 "Report from the Mandate"
  britain.2000.d:0 "A curious report has reached the office of Sir John French, Commissioner of the British Expeditionary Force in Palestine. The report, delivered by agents of the Imperial Security Service, contained a series of reports by Jordanian and Palestinian travelers that a white man traveling alone in the Jordanian desert has been spotted on multiple occasions. It went on to indicate a high probability that the man being referred to may be the missing British Colonel Thomas Edward Lawrence, though it cannot confirm this with absolute certainty.\n\nLawrence vanished from his posting in the Trucial States following the end of hostilities in the Great War. The reason for his disappearence is unknown, but colleagues attested to the ISS that his service during the North African campaign and the Arab Peacekeeping operations may have pushed him over the edge. Lawrence's fascination with the Middle East is well known, and ISS agents have been combing the Arab Kingdoms for almost two decades in an effort to locate him. If this lead is to be believed, Lawrence may have been hiding beneath our noses this entire time. Our ISS office in Jerusalem has advised that we dispatch an agent to Jordan to locate this unidentified man post haste, as we may lose our chance to find him with the brewing chaos in the Near East."

  britain.2001.t:0 "A Meeting in the Dunes"
  britain.2001.d:0 "After almost a week's travel, IIS agents arrived at the campsite in the Jordanian desert where it was believed Lawrence was hiding out. Evidence of recent habitation was found, particularly several opened cans of food and a recently snuffed out campfire. Before the agents could investigate further, the cocking of a pistol drew the agents' attention to their flank.\n\nThere, masked in the amber glow of the setting desert sun, stood T.E Lawrence, though at first he was hardly recognizable. Dirty, unshaven and draped in Arab garb, he hardly looked anything like the file photo the agents had been given.\n\n\"I figured you people would come looking for me eventually.\"\n\n\"We're with Imperial Intelligence, we've been asked to bring you in for reassign-\"\n\n\"I'm not going back. Not after what we did.\"\n\nThe agents looked amongst one another, and after a tense silence, the head of the operation spoke, hand lingering near his revolver."

  britain.2002.t:0 "Come Home Again"
  britain.2002.d:0 "There was a long silence after the agent spoke, punctuated with a deep sigh from Lawrence as he lowered the pistol. He took a long look out at the desert wastes that surrounded them, the wind sweeping over the dunes like a neverending ocean of dust.\n\nThe pistol found its' home in his holster. Ozymandias demanded his service once more, to protect his empire one last time before it slipped from his fingers and into the dustbin of history. It didn't matter if it was King Edward or King George, the Emperors were all the same.\n\nStill, in a way he figured he owed his homeland some courtesy for not putting him down like a rabid dog. Sometimes, a hound gone wild still has use left in him for his master. One last ride, he figured, one last ride for the Empire.\n\nOne last ride and he could finally be free, spilling blood just this one time more in exchange for freedom.\n\nThey left the next morning for the border of the mandate, and though Lawrence couldn't shake his pessimism, he did have to admit it would be nice to have a proper bed again."
  britain.2002.a:0 "One last ride, for old time's sake."

  britain.2003.t:0 "Never Again"
  britain.2003.d:0 "There was a long silence after the agent spoke, punctuated with a deep sigh from Lawrence as he lowered the pistol. He took a long look out at the desert wastes that surrounded them, the wind sweeping over the dunes like a neverending ocean of dust.\n\nHe could remember Algiers just as vividly as the day it happened, the screams, the blood, the acrid smell of explosives that hung in the air. The French garrison had refused to surrender, and his body shook when he recalled how their commanders had simply shrugged and given the order to open fire. Tens of thousands of tonnes of steel hellfire raining down on a city of nearly a million, and he just sat back and watched, and he swore he would never raise a rifle for the Empire again.\n\nThe agents left silently, riding off home to their masters. Lawrence continued on as though they had never came, pouring over endless tomes of obscure Arabian history. Perhaps, he figured, one day he might make the trip to Mecca once this terrible succession war business blows over.\n\nThe contents of the Lawrence report submitted to the IIS were unremarkable, and few questioned the statements on some Great War fossil lost in his own madness in a savage desert. The report was filed away among the millions of reports in the IIS archives, disappearing into an ocean of bureaucracy, and with it went the last memories of Colonel Lawrence."

  britain.2004.t:0 "The Last Enemy to be Destroyed..."
  britain.2004.d:0 "The shrieks of gunfire broke the silence as the agents opened up on him, catching the Colonel off guard. Bullets ripped through him, knocking him back as he landed face first in the sand. As blood pooled around him, his fading vision caught one last glimpse of the setting desert sun, the light reflecting off his own blood as it mixed with the sweeping sand.\n\nColonel Lawrence bled to death an hour later, hogtied on the back of a camel headed back to Palestine. Though the agents tasked with acquiring him received a chewing out, most in the IIS concluded the man was a loose cannon. It wasn't their job to rescue some Great War veteran from his own madness, after all.\n\nColonel Lawrence found his resting place a little over a month later in a Veteran's cemetary in Wales. Though the grave was periodically the host to small gatherings by veterans of the Algiers Campaign, over time the meetings would fade away, along with whatver memory of Colonel Lawrence that might have remained."

I have already dealt with the three you have sent, and it would be most wonderful if you did not send any more. I understand my disappearance may have caused some concerns, however I feel that it would be a terrible waste of manpower to send any more chaps to kill me. As a token of my good will, I've attached this letter to the remains of the poor men you've sent to their deaths and I should hope their remains have made it to Palestine unscathed.\n\nIf you continue sending killers, I'll send a very fast working one to Jerusalem and I certainly won't have to send another."

  britain.2006.t:0 "The Engagement of Princess Mary"
  britain.2006.d:0 "Princess Mary, the only daughter of his late Imperial Majesty King-Emperor George V, announced her engagement to American businessman and veteran Quentin Roosevelt. The announcement came as something of a surprise for the public, though the contact between the two had been an open secret within the royal family.\n\nDriven out of seclusion by the Great War, Princess Mary helped launch a series of charity campaigns in Britain to support veterans. Roosevelt, on leave in the isles due to being wounded on the Iberian front, briefly met the princess at a charity event and the two began correspondance. Roosevelt's status as a war hero in the Americas and his family standing among the American aristocracy paved the way for celebrity across the Empire. Both continued their efforts for Veterans charities while corresponding, ultimately leading to their engagement.\n\nThe marriage of the two marks the most official formation of ties between the Americas and Britain, with American and British hardline loyalists lauding the affair as an example of the Anglo-American imperial identity. The King-Emperor has remained largely quiet on the affairs of his sister, and the rest of the Royal Family has given the courtship a bregruding approval."

  britain.2007.t:0 "The Rise of the Swing Scene"
  britain.2007.d:0 "British propaganda has always emphasized the so called \"Mixing Pot\" of the Empire, and no development demonstrates this further than the growth of London's underground music culture. Heavily influenced by immigration from the Americas during the Bleeding South, \"Swing\" music has become a craze among Britain's youth.\n\nEmphasizing big bands, trumpets and string compositions, Swing music developed as a local phenomena among Black American immigrants and soon mixed with the cultural milieu of Great Britain. Taking influence from everything from German orchestra to local folk tunes, the development of Swing music in Britain has birthed something wholly unique, and despite the best efforts of moral censors, it seems rowdy kids can't get enough of it."

  britain.4000.d:0 "After years of dilligent work, the Nicaragua Canal has finally been completed. Through thick and thin, British support for the project has at long last paid off. In a lavish ceremony, British nobility and corporate officials celebrated the completion of the canal and the splendor of the Empire's economic might. The announcement was soon followed by the formation of the Nicaragua Canal Company, a state-managed Imperial Corporation which will be responsible for policing and maintaining the Canal's facilities.\n\nThe occasion has not been entirely without controversy, as the Nicaraguan government voiced displeasure at their minimal role in the NCC, which will see them see very few of the dividends from the canal taxes. Some more radical elements of the government outright denounced the British and have avowed their efforts to take back supposedly rightful Nicaraguan land. Controversy still surrounds the canal even beyond this, as many British reformists argued against the use of poorly paid locals and African \"travel workers\", the latter of which received almost no pay at all save room and provisions. Nevertheless, Britain has acquired yet another powerful economic chip in global geopolitics. Alongside the Suez, Britain has a tremendously powerful monopoly on global and inter-empire trade."

  britain.4001.d:0 "Unfortunately, our efforts to pressure the foremen to hurry it up on construction of the Nicaragua canal have backfired. Attempting to meet the increased demands, the foremen at the canal made a series of errors leading to damage at the construction site and the deaths of several workers.\n\nThey have since requested that we not attempt to interfere further with their work projections, so as to prevent any further accidents from sloppy worksmanship."

  ENG_Edward_VIII_Desc:0 "His Majesty, King-Emperor Edward VIII has arisen to the crown with the death of his father, King George V. He finds himself reigning over a troubled nation, and an even more troubled empire. Noted for his open distaste for the rising popularity of the Worker's Union party, many leftists now fear that Edward might abandon his political neutrality as King to interfere in politics. Amidst economic and political uncertainty, Edward's rise to power and lack of concern for constitutional processes has done little to ease the government's worries."
  ENG_King_George_Desc:0 "Born George Frederick Ernest Albert in 1865, His Royal Highness King George V, Emperor of India and the British Empire, is in many ways a man that lives within the shadow of his father. Succeeding Edward VII after his death in 1910, George inherited an empire utterly traumatized by the single most horrific conflict in human history. With Europe clutched tight in the grip of economic depression, only economic isolationism could prevent privation, and so George V oversaw the establishment of Britain's diplomatic and economic isolationism from Europe. George V is most known for the catastrophic failure of the Indian Campaign, which saw the warhawk conservative goverment attempt to bolster their popularity with a quick campaign into India, hoping to finally rectify a black stain on British imperial history. George V openly endorsed the campaign and, when British forces were forced to halt due to heavy losses, his credability and the credability of the conservatives was badly damaged. This would ultimately force the conservatives into a coalition government with the Whig party in the subsequent elections. Now, in 1933, George's health has begun to fail him. Frequently ill and delegating affairs to the rest of the Royal family, many fear that George's death is imminent."
