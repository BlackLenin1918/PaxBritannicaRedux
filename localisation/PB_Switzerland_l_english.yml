  swiss.1.t:0 "Leadup to the 1936 Olympics - Status of the German States"
  swiss.1.d:0 "The 1936 Olympics are set to begin in August, and thus we need to make some key decisions regarding the games, most of them political in nature. The first item on the docket is the issue of the German states. The issue of the disunited Germany has been a hot-button topic. There are a few potential solutions to the issue. The first is to simply have all the German states compete independently, which would appear the most politically impartial. The second would be to only allow Free Germany and the German National State to play, while icing the German Soviet Republic out of the games. Alternatively, we could simply opt to remove all the states from the games and allow German players to attend under an independent banner."
  swiss.1.a:0 "Allow all German nations to play"
  swiss.1.b:0 "Ban the German Soviet Republic"
  swiss.1.c:0 "The independent option."
  swiss.2.t:0 "Leadup to the 1936 Olympics - Status of the USASR"
  swiss.2.d:0 "The Olympic games are supposed to be apolitical, but naturally we sometimes have to make decisions on recognition. Brazil, currently known as the Union of South American Socialist Republics, is an international pariah. The existence of the Guyana enclave further complicates matters, with Brazilian nationalists still claiming to be the true government of the nation. There are calls to refuse to recognize the USASR and thus prevent them from playing in the olympic games. On the other hand, allowing them to play could be seen as recognizing what is, to most nations, a rogue state."
  swiss.2.a:0 "Ban the Reds from the games."
  swiss.2.b:0 "Let's not get political."
