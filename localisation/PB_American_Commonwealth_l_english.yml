PB_AME_Iberian_Legacy:0 "Legacy of the Iberian Campaign"
PB_AME_Iberian_Legacy_desc:0 "The Commonwealth played a pivotal role in the Iberian Campaign, but payed a dear cost for it. The thousands of dead and wounded remain a black mark on Anglo-American military history, and have lead to a deep resentment of Britain."
PB_AME_Dixie_Divide:0 "The Dixie Divide"
PB_AME_Dixie_Divide_desc:0 "In many ways, America remains deeply divided between North and South. The more liberal North, with its’ greater industry, has dominated the South since the Southern Rebellion. With poverty rampant in the South and the increasing social liberalization of the nation, tension in the South has reached a fever pitch."

PB_AME_The_Bleeding_South_desc:0 "Racial tensions in the Southern states have always been uneasy. Creating not only a physcial divide between north and south but a political one as well with the North seen as a bastion of democracy, freedom, and progress. The South in their eyes as a rural backwater with rather outdated and barbaric traditions and customs. This rivalry has eventually reached its boiling point and there is now word of a southern uprising.\n\n§RWe have limited time to prepare for whats coming§!"
AME_Test:0 "CLICK THIS TO ENABLE THE BLEEDING SOUTH"
AME_Southern_Rebellion:0 "Southern Rebellion"
AME_Southern_Rebellion_desc:0 "For far too long we have been ignored by the suits in Philadelphia. They openly spit on our faces and insult us whenver they very damn well please but we have had enough of it. No longer will our traditions, morals, and beliefs be hampered on by an administration so folly. So I call you brothers, rise, rise, rise up into Dixie Land!\n\n§RAnd End This Charade Once And For All!§!"
AME_Civil_Unrest:0 "Civil Unrest"
AME_Civil_Unrest_desc:0 "It is only time until we see the south proclaim independence but while the clock ticks down we have other pressing matters to attend to. Riots, corruption, and racial tensions are all being birthed in this moment of strife. We must, at the very least, attempt to control the situation else face intervention from our fathers in Britain."

# Events
Bleeding_South1title:0 "Violent Riots"
Bleeding_South1desc:0 "The officer's pristine blue uniform aided little in the ensuing battle for the city roads, a war undeclared but very much active between the local authorities and white civilain population. Racial slurs rant rampant and armed showdowns occured in approximately five minute intervals. The south at this moment turned into a cesspool of degeneracy as frequent confrontations between other races, mainly between black and white, turned violent. Though as the night quietened so did the riots. But a new day would bring new "festivities"."

Bleeding_South2title:0 "Racial Street Brawl"
Bleeding_South2desc:0 "A lone laundromat located in a predominantly white suburb laid victim to a bloody beating today. Local reports state that a young Africian-American entered the laundromat to do business when a gang of masked individuals, assumed to be stalking the boy, jumped him and draged him into the middle of the road, where they, Quote on quote. "Beat the fucking shit out of him". Said by locals present at the time. Apparently a few minutes later the beating turned into an ugly confrontation between the black and white local populations and a street brawl followed suite.\n\nThe young boy is now dead as a result of the beating."

Bleeding_South3title:0 "Talks Of Corruption"
Bleeding_South3desc:0 "Rumours have spread that local officials are accepting large amounts of money to turn a blind eye in regards to southern mobilization and the raising of state funded militias. We have little power to intervene and doing so would likely on escalate the situation so as it stands the south only gets stronger.\n\nAnd more corrupt. "

Bleeding_South4title:0 "Weapons Depot Raided"
Bleeding_South4desc:0 "A local garrison has just responded to the head of military affairs stating that a raid from a rag-tag militia group has just occured. Overwhelmed the garrison is said to have given up arms with little resistance. In fact it is said a large proportion of soliders defected to the militias cause.\n\nNow they grow stronger in size."

Bleeding_South5title:0 "The Dixie Uprising"
Bleeding_South5desc:0 "The garrison in Savannah stopped responding at 09:00 today. The most recent broadcast from yesterday spoke of rising unrest and the near collapse of the authoritie's hold on the city, stating that unless Northern aid arrives the garrison will likely defect to the SFA (Free States Alliance). The SFA remains the largest political body against northern rule in the south. Lead by southern landowners it is likely the worst has just begun and will only continue from this point on. Our military have already responded by mobilizing in preparation for the inevitable civil war as gunshots can already be heard in most major Southern cities. "
