news.1.t:0 "The Death of King George"
news.1.d:0 "The King-Emperor of the British Empire, George V, is dead. Crowned in 1910, George V is notable for having seen the British Empire through one of the most contentious periods in its’ long history. Guiding the nation through the perils of the Great War, the King’s leadership proved a stabilizing force for an empire that, at times, seemed to be coming apart at the seams. The grandson of the almost mythologized Queen Victoria, George’s reforms helped to keep the Empire together throughout the crises of the 1920s and 30s, and is succeeded by his son Edward, now crowned Edward VIII"
news.1.a:0 "How terrible."

news.23.t:0 "Britain has fallen!"
news.23.d:0 "The British Isles, long the economic center of Europe and, to an extent, the world, has fallen. Foreign invaders march in the streets as Londoners watch in terror. The British government has fled, in exile, to Canada, where they state their intention to carry on the struggle. Throughout the world, the ripples of the British capitulation are being felt, and talks of independence and revolution are rife throughout the colonies. Predatory powers now look to the former British lands for the chance to pounce upon them like scavengers. The Pax Britannica has not just ended, it has been utterly shattered, and the world must move forwards into a new, dark age."
news.23.a:0 "Their empire may soon follow..."

news.38.t:0 "The Irish Revolution"
news.38.d:0 "It’s no secret that the Irish have voiced their discontent in being part of the British Empire, whether it by via words or the barrel of a gun. The 1916 Dublin Uprising and the subsequent violent crackdown by British authorities caused great resentment among Irishmen, particularly those that lost loved ones to the British forces during the Battle of Dublin. These tensions have fermented in a full scale revolution against the British. Irish militias now patrol the streets of Dublin, headed by their respective ideological faction."
news.38.a:0 "Best of luck to them."

news.39.t:0 "PM Mosley \n England Lives, and Marches on!"
news.39.d:0 "\n With the fall of France, Prime Minister Mosley of the United Kingdom addressed Parliament and, by extension, the British Empire on the whole. The young PM, having risen to power on a ticket of economic self sufficiency in the empire, took to his speech with the same firebrand bombasity that carried him into office. \n\n “We say that Britain is not finished, we say that Britain is not dead! Today, we send all the world the message - England Lives, and marches on!” Whether Mosley and the British Empire will weather the coming storm remains to be seen, but at least for today, he has secured the confidence of Parliament and his nation."
news.39.a:0 "The Britons have lit a flame which shall not be extinguished."

news.41.t:0 "The Dissolution of the United Kingdom"
news.41.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the United Kingdom has dissolved. Following a military coup and an extremist regime, former states of the British Isles like Wales, Scotland and Ireland have broken away from the British and declared independence. With the collapse of the United Kingdom, much of the Empire has been set adrift without leadership. Opportunistic enemies have set their sights on the former colonies and dominions of the Empire, which now find themselves undefended against the enemy onslaught.\n\n The Collapse of the UK marks a dramatic end to the British Empire, and now leaves a vast power vacuum for new up and coming powers to seize control."
news.41.a:0 "The Sun finally sets, it seems..."

news.42.t:0 "Renewal of the Luso-British Alliance"
news.42.d:0 "Diplomats representing the governments of Portugal and the United Kingdom announced the renewal of the Lisbon-London Pact. Portuguese officials welcomed the renewal of the alliance, noting the longstanding continuity of Anglo-Portuguese cooperation. [POR.GetLeader] marked the occasion with a diplomatic tour of the United Kingdom, concluding with a personal meeting with the King-Emperor. \n\n The introduction of Portugal to the Commonwealth marks a considerable shift in power in Iberia. Portuguese interwar neutrality had previously ensured Spain had no threats in the region."
news.42.a:0 "An interesting development."

news.43.t:0 "The Fall of Britain"
news.43.d:0 "Britain has fallen. Victorious enemy troops now march through the streets and cities of what was once the hub of the British Empire, now reduced to smoldering ruins and occupation. The British government, along with the Royal family, have fled to North America alongside thousands of refugees. Having assumed direct control of Canada, the new British Government in Exile now lies on unsteady foundations as the empire begins to come apart at the seams. \n\n With the Dominions in chaos and under threat of local insurrection, many former British colonial states now seek independence from the new Ottowa government. The event that has been feared since William the Conquerer set foot on English soil has finally come to pass."
news.43.a:0 "A new order begins today."

news.44.t:0 "Edwardian Coup in Britain"
news.44.d:0 "Rogue forces of the British Expeditionary Force stormed Parliament this morning on orders of the so-called “Harris Clique” this morning. The Clique, lead by the Air Marshall and strategic bombing advocate, has officially dissolved Parliament on orders of the King-Emperor Edward, who lent his official support to the group. \n\n The end of British democracy, for now, has seen mixed reception throughout the nation. Many moderates and leftists, including the the firebrand Oswald Mosley, have condemned the act and vow resistance to the new regime. Others, including major hardline Tory leaders, have offered their support for the Edwardian government."
news.44.c:0 "The man will ruin himself within twelve months."

news.45.t:0 "Edward VIII Abdicates"
news.45.d:0 "Facing immense pressure amidst scandal, the King-Emperor of the British Empire, Edward VIII, has chosen to abdicate the throne. Addressing the nation, the King stated that he “heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.” Edward’s abdication leaves his younger brother, George, to assume the throne as the new King-Emperor of the British Empire. \n\n Given the new King’s staunch constitutional stance, few objections are expected to be made to his ascension to the throne."
news.45.c:0 "Good luck to him."

# AUSTRIAN REICH
#########################
news.7.t:0 "The Habsburg Restoration"
news.7.d:0 "In an impressive ceremony at the Vienna Conference, the ultranationalist Fatherland Front has voted to elect Otto von Habsburg as the new Emperor of the Austrian Reich. Otto, previously in exile, has been an ardent supporter for the new regime since it seized power in the mid 1930s. The austere show, culminating in an air display by the Austrian Luftstreitkräfte, marks a new change in the previously hardcore ultranationalist state. Otto himself is a proponent of the so-called “Monarchofascist” movement, combining elements of traditional ultranationalist thought and absolutist monarchy. How this movement will change Austria remains to be seen."
news.7.a:0 "Intriguing."

news.8.t:0 "Rise of Austrian Strasserism"
news.8.d:0 "In a surprise move by the attendants of the 1937 Vienna Conference in Austria, Gregor Strasser has been voted to take office as the new Chancellor of the nation. Heading the so-called “Strasserist Block”, he has pushed for a more distinctly socialist Fatherland Front since it seized power in the 1930s. Now, as acting Chancellor, the world waits with baited breath to see what will come out of the new Austrian People’s Reich."
news.8.a:0 "An interesting move."

news.9.t:0 "Political Chaos in Austria"
news.9.d:0 "Following a period of dissent against the new Imperial government, the Austrian Reich has broken down into political anarchy. Minor conflicts have flared up in the cities as the opposition block, allied with army officials, have begun seizing loyalists with the intent to force newly crowned Emperor Otto into figurehead status. Angry neighbors have begun to eye the Austrians closely, some seeking to reclaim lost territory. How the situation will play out remains to be seen."
news.9.a:0 "How terrible."

news.10.t:0 "Hungarians revolt in Austrian Reich"
news.10.d:0 "In the wake of a period of political dispute within the Austrian regime, it seems the entire country’s foundation has begun to come apart. Following a series of commando raids in Budapest, a provisional Hungarian government has been announced. Headed, by underground resistance leader Géza Lakatos, the provisional regime seeks full independence from Austria. How the government in Vienna will respond is hard to say, but it is unlikely that this movement is going to succeed by words alone."
news.10.a:0 "How curious."

news.11.t:0 "Royalist coup in Austria!"
news.11.d:0 "The Austrian Reich has come to a crashing end. In the night, Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg revealed his hand as a monarchist sympathizer and, cooperating with a cadre of officers and moderates, has seized control of government buildings in Vienna. It remains to be seen how this will affect relations with the outside world, or if this is a true change for moderate politics by the Reich. Regardless, it seems that the dream imagined by the Fatherland Front has come to a crashing halt."
news.11.a:0 "Incredible."

news.12.t:0 "The Austro-Turkish Alliance"
news.12.d:0 "The governments of the Austrian Reich and Turkey have announced that they have officially renewed diplomatic and military ties. Under the Vienna-Ankara Accords, the two nations have pledged to each others defense. A formal reply has not been provided by London, but many have pointed out the repetition of the previous war’s events. The former alliance between the two nations, the Central Powers, played an integral role in the First Great War. Whether or not the Tripartite Pact will do the same remains to be seen."
news.12.a:0 "Interesting."

news.13.t:0 "The Austro-Serbian War"
news.13.d:0 "The Balkans have long been a place of political instability and conflict. This trend continues with the declaration of hostilities between the Austrian Reich and Serbia. The two nations have long been at odds since the Reich’s expansions during the late 1920s and early 1930s. Now, tension has turned to open conflict, and the fate of the Balkans shall be decided on this battlefield."
news.13.a:0 "How terrible."

news.14.t:0 "Austria annexes Serbia"
news.14.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the Serbian government has conceded to demands from the Austrian Reich and has been fully annexed. Elements of the Serbian government have fled into the Italian peninsula and surrounding Balkan nations. Some have claimed that Austrian officials intend to “germanize” the region, effectively wiping out any Serbian culture for full integration. British and French officials have condemned the action in the Union of Nations, but were unwilling to declare allegiance to the disgruntled Serbs. It seems Austrian expansionism will continue without resistance."
news.14.a:0 "How terrible."

news.15.t:0 "The Second Balkan League"
news.15.d:0 "In response to Austrian expansionism in the region, Serbian officials have announced the formation of the Second Balkan League. The former league, formed in response to the Ottoman rule in the area, fell apart decades prior after a betrayal by Bulgaria. Today, however, the Serbian foreign ministry believes that a new Balkan League might be able to curtail Austria’s imperial ambitions for the region or, failing that, provide mutual defense for their fellow Balkan nations."
news.15.a:0 "Interesing."

news.16.t:0 "The Iron Guard Rebellion"
news.16.d:0 "In the years since the Austrian Reich rose to power in the Balkans, it has maintained Romania as a satellite state. Policed by the Iron Guard and administrated by the Austrian military, the region had for some time been part of Austria’s planned “Balkans Germanization Initiative.” It seems this plan has come collapsing down before it even began. An attempt to purge the Iron Guard leadership and establish full Austrian control has lead to the Iron Guard itself seizing control and declaring independence. How this will affect Austrian ambition remains to be seen, but it seems the fight for Romanian Independence has begun today."
news.16.a:0 "Their fight has just begun."

news.18.t:0 "Austria announces support for Prussia"
news.18.d:0 "The German nation is still a fiercely divided one. Since their defeat by the Triple Entente in the First Great War, the country was fractious at best. Tensions between the various political parties exploded during the Battle of Berlin, in which radical communists, ultranationalists and loyalists fell into brutal street fighting. The first shots that night would be the first shot of the Weimar Civil War. The unofficial armistice has since kept the various German nations at peace. Today, however, diplomats from the Austrian Reich announced their support for a Prussian-unified German state at the League of Nations."

news.19.t:0 "Prussia annexes the Rhineland"
news.19.d:0 "A shocking display today as Prussian forces marched into the Rhenish Republic to enforce annexation. The former French client state, created via an intervention in the Weimar Civil War, is no more. Backed by the Austrian Reich and the Tripartite Pact, the Prussian government announced that it is now much closer to reuniting the former territories of the German Empire. No comment was provided by the French government, who have been condemned in various circles of the international community for what has been seen as a policy of appeasement. Members of the former Rhenish government have fled into neighboring France, having been labeled traitors by the vengeful Prussians."
news.19.a:0 "One step closer to a united Germany"

news.20.t:0 "The Rhineland Crisis"
news.20.d:0 "Diplomatic channels have completely broken down between France, Prussia and the Tripartite Pact. The Rhineland Crisis has exploded into a full blown war between the French Empire and the Tripartite Pact. An emergency meeting of the League of Nations has produced no resolution, as reports have come in of fighting in the Rhineland and abroad. The response from London has been one of strong condemnation, and many believe that the conflict may provoke the British to renew their diplomatic ties with the French. The ramifications of this conflict remain to be seen, but it is likely that other nations in Europe are soon to be involved, whether they wish to or not."
news.20.a:0 "War comes to Europe once more."

news.21.t:0 "The Resolution of the Rhineland Crisis"
news.21.d:0 "Tensions over the Rhineland have been eased today, as the French government announced that Austria and Prussia have stood down from their demands for the region. This comes as somewhat of a surprise to the international community, as many believed the incident would most assuredly lead to conflict. Instead, the Austro-Prussian diplomatic coalition has backed down, and has faced major political backlash at home. Though some political experts see this as a temporary solution, many are simply relieved that the issue was resolved peacefully."
news.21.a:0 "A peaceful resolution, at least."

news.22.t:0 "The Tokyo-Vienna Pact"
news.22.d:0 "News from Tokyo today as diplomats from Austria and Japan have officially signed a pact of mutual defense, marking Japan’s official entry into the Tripartite Pact. Japan, despite being a victor in the Great War, has suffered greatly from internal strife since the Treaty of Versailles. Now, the burgeoning Empire has a new ally in Europe, giving rise to fears among the crowned heads of Europe that the up and coming power may attempt to seize Pacific colonies. The dream of “Asia ruled by Asians” seems closer than ever to reality. "
news.22.a:0 "Concerning, to say the least."

# LONDON STOCK CRISIS

news.17.t:0 "The London Stock Crisis"
news.17.d:0 "Since the Great War, the economy of the United Kingdom has been in a state of stagnation. It had not reached the level of a full blown crisis until, just days ago, a sudden stock panic has effectively collapsed many major London-based investment groups. The subsequent domino effect has wrecked the British economy, causing mass unemployment virtually overnight. The strain has first been felt in Europe, and then in the Commonwealth abroad. As London attempts to pick up the pieces, many nations find themselves not just lacking funds, but at the hands of an angry and unemployed populace."

news.28.d:0 "With the economic crisis in full swing, the Chinese Republic has fallen to an outright military coup. Field Marshall Chiang kai Shek announced to the international community and his new subjects that he and his Beijing Clique had assumed control to “protect China from the threat of communist insurgency. Concerns have been raised by the former Republican government, who have decried Chiang’s new military cabal as making a blatant power grab. Backed by General Yan Xishan, Chiang and the military claim that they intend to exert their control over China until such time as “their rule is no longer needed.”"

news.29.t:0 "The Chinese Civil War"
news.29.d:0 "As anarchy reigns in the streets of Nanjing, communist forces have begun their march on the capital to seize what remains of the nation for the revolution. Having been decimated by the stock crisis, China has been thrust into electoral gridlock. The terrible state of affairs was exacerbated not long ago by an aborted coup by Field Marshal and ardent anti-communist Chiang kai Shek. Though Chiang and his so-called “Beijing Clique” have been apprehended, the damage to the republic has been done."
news.29.a:0 "History repeats itself..."

news.30.t:0 "Civil War erupts in China"
news.30.d:0 "Since Chiang’s coup following the Stock Crisis, China has backslid once more into authoritarianism. The efforts to consolidate the new regime have brought chaos to the nation, as moderates and leftists faced intense persecution over fears of communist influence. All of this has come to a head, as Li Lisan and the Chinese Communists have arisen around Beijing to challenge the new Chinese order. Similarly, Sun Fo and a coalition of moderate Republicans have taken over Nanjing via sympathetic military officers. All three sides now look to secure their command over China, as the situation degenerates"
news.30.a:0 "Instability in China? Shocking."

news.31.t:0 "Civil War erupts in China"
news.31.d:0 "China’s economic freefall since the Stock Crisis has birthed a full-blown catastrophe. Prompted by the seeming inability of the Nanjing government to remedy the crisis, Chinese communists have seized control of the North around Beijing. Announcing themselves as the “People’s Liberation Army”, the communists seek to overthrow the Chinese government and install a socialist regime. As loyalist forces mobilize, China’s autonomous regions have begun to break off and seek independence, while opportunistic neighbors eye the Middle Kingdom greedily..."
news.31.a:0 "Instability in China? Shocking."

news.32.t:0 "The Beijing Massacre"
news.32.d:0 "Blood is in the streets of Beijing as the Chinese Army clashes with labour unionists and communists. Acting to break an ongoing general strike, the Army pushed into the area around Beijing with the intention of arresting those involved and getting the situation under control. Their actions did the opposite, it seems, and communist paramilitiaries quickly acted against the Army. Republican troops have opened fire on protestors in several areas of the city, turning Beijing into a warzone. This may likely be just the beginning of leftist agitation in China."

news.33.d:0 "Elections in France have concluded with a narrow victory for Leon Blum’s Parti Radical, securing a narrow victory over the reactionary National Salvation Front and the socialist Popular Front. Speaking from the steps of the Estates-General in Paris, the new Prime Minister announced that “a new period of peace and stability shall begin here, today, in France.” Blum’s government promises a return to stability for the French Empire, which has seen considerable decline since the end of the Great War and the Great Slump."

news.34.t:0 "FSN Elected in France"
news.34.d:0 "Elections in France have ended in a narrow victory for the FSN, headed by former general Phillipe Pétain. The FSN, or National Salvation Front, is a coalition party of various conservatives, reactionaries, ultranationalists and monarchists. Pétain, speaking from the Estates-General in Paris, announced his intention to restore France to her former imperial glory, and promising to re-establish France as the true preeminent empire on the continent. Such statements have garnered him little love from the British embassy in Paris."

news.35.d:0 "Elections in France have ended with a narrow victory for the Popular Front under Maurice Thorez. Thorez, a moderate socialist, has lead the front for more than three years now. Finally, it seems, the maligned socialist party has seen a majority. Thorez, speaking before a gathered crowd in Paris, stated that this was a victory for the working man, and announced his intention to renew the spirit of France. Thorez’ “Radical Reform” plan is now poised to be introduced to the French Estates-General."

news.36.t:0 "The Paris Commune"
news.36.d:0 "Conflict in Paris today as the governmental crisis has exploded into conflict. Armed Parisians, backed by the French Jacobin party, have seized control throughout the capital. The so-called Paris Commune has since been formally proclaimed, and similar militant communes have been proclaimed throughout the nation. With anarchy beginning to reign throughout France, it seems that the twilight of the declining French Empire might have arrived."
news.36.c:0 "How horrible!"

news.37.t:0 "The French Civil War"
news.37.d:0 "With economic inequality becoming widespread and political violence taking over, France has been plunged into a full scale civil war. [FRA.GetLeader], speaking via the Imperial National Radio, stated their intent to “prosecute the conflict against these traitors to it’s utmost conclusion” and that the “fire of French resistance shall not be snuffed out today, nor any other day.” \n\n Imperial France, having acted as a balancing force in Western Europe, has already begun to see its empire unraveling.

Communes across the East have begun to disperse as the police move in to restore order. With stability returning to the region, the French Empire can breathe a sigh of relief. Though a victory has been won today, tensions still remain across the Rhine, and it remains to be seen if the French can meet the challenge posed by the German situation."

The French Civil War, one of the bloodiest conflicts to grip the nation, has finally come to a close. The last vestiges of the Nationalist forces have either fled abroad or vowed to continue resistance to the new regime. Though there are many fires to put out and bodies to be buried, the Communards stand victorious today."

With many new African nations sprouting out of the moldering colonial state, Emperor Haile Selassie of Abyssinia brought together a congress of delegates from the African states to discuss the formation of an “African National Congress.” The Congress, or ANC, is an international entity dedicated to the fostering of African nationalism and national identity throughout the continent. \n\n It seems that the once subdued consciousness of Africa is beginning to rise again."

generalflavour.1.d:0 "The International Exposition of Art and Technology opened in Paris today. A demonstration of the wonders of modern technology, the fair was held in a lavish pavilion around the Eiffel Tower. Nations from around the world were invited to come and display their prowess to the world. Several notable pavilions attracted the attention of the international press, particularly the British pavilion which demonstrated the “New London Community” project of Albert Speer. Commissioned by the British government, Speer’s brutalist modern designs for the British capital indicate a shift towards modernity for the aging empire. Other pavilions included the Westphalian demonstration of early jet engine designs and the Japanese pavilion demonstrating a recreation of a traditional Shinto shrine."
generalflavour.1.a:0 "How interesting"

generalflavour.2.t:0 "J. C. Squire's Washingtonia"
generalflavour.2.d:0 "J. C. Squire, notable British author, released his novel “Washingtonia” today. The story follows a group of partisans in the “American Empire” in an alternate timeline to our own. Squire’s novel details how George Washington and a cabal of aristocratic slave-owners successfully defeat the British and take control over the Thirteen Colonies in British North America. Washington quickly acts to install himself as a military dictator and eventual emperor of the Empire, with subsequent Emperors stretching the nation’s borders to the Pacific and even into Northern Mexico. The expansionist American Empire soon goes on to invade Canada, pushing across the Atlantic to invade the British Isles. \n \n  The story of the novel begins in the alternate future of the 1960s, where the American Empire is in a perpetual war with a coalition of nations including Russia and China. The main characters are a group of former British infantrymen acting as partisans against the Americans, who have reorganized society entirely around corporatism and perpetual war, while even the most basic of social services are ignored. Rallying a small army of British nationalists, the story follows our protagonists in their underground campaign to liberate the occupied British isles. Squire’s story has faced some criticism, with most calling the Empire “space-filling” and that the idea of America winning their war for independence in the first place is unrealistic at best."

generalflavour.3.d:0 "The attention of the world turns to Spain today for the opening ceremony of the 1936 Barcelona Summer Olympics. These games have proven to be exceptionally contentious, and not for the typical reasons of friendly national rivalry. The bitter Imperial rivalries between the British and French nations seem poised to be fought not with rifles, but out on the field. Similarly, the issue of recognition of the German states and the USASR has been a major issue. Some joviality could be found in the Spanish crowds, who welcomed the many visiting heads of state to thunderous applause. Alfonso XIII, current head of the Bourbon dual monarchies in Spain and France, personally inaugurated the games, which are set to conclude on the 16th."

The last qualifying rounds have left a small number of nations prepared to compete. Currently, the Spanish, English and Austrian teams are projected to reach the qualifying rounds by experts.

generalflavour.11.d:0 "Eric Blair, writing from Broadmoor Hospital in England, published his novel “Father Britain” today. The one time leader of Independent Labour, Blair was institutionalized for mental illness due to his ties to Neo-Marxist groups. Under the new “Mental Hygiene Act”, Blair has since been under treatment for “Bolshevik leanings”, but was allowed by hospital staff to write, who believed it to be therapeutic. Blair’s novel, “Father Britain” describes a nightmarish dystopian future, clearly inspired by the proto-authoritarian laws implemented by the Churchill administration.\n\n The novel follows the character of Winston Smith, living in the isles of “Greater Britannia” in the far off year of 1984. The nation is a brutally repressive dictatorship, centered around the “Imperial Party”, which governs the nation with a iron fist. At the head of this party is the near mythical “Father Britain”, a ubiquitous figure present in all media and propaganda clearly inspired by Churchill. Alongside the British “Emperor”, Father Britain and the Party lead Britannia and her allies in a near constant war against similar superstates, particularly the European Commonwealth and the East Asian Empire. Smith ultimately rebells against the Ultranationalist government by having an affair with an “inferor” colonial woman, but is intercepted in his attempts to attack the government directly through rebellion. \n\n The book concludes with Smith being sent to die in an antarctic labour camp, while the world descends into anarchy as the Imperial powers begin using atomic missiles against one another. The novel has been outright banned in the British Empire, but has seen great popularity throughout Europe and the colonies, with many sympathizing with the harsh anti-British message."

The majority of the story follows the political machinations of the various factions in Eastern Europe, dealing with the conflicts between the various Cossack, Polish and Lithuanian groups trying to fight for power in a world without the great Empires of ours. \n\n The story follows how the different groups, initially opposed to one another, must unite once more to stop a resurgent Mongolian Khanate sweeping from the East. The novella has found moderate success in Eastern Europe, largely due to it’s heroic portrayal of the various ethnic groups in the region, though some have criticized Moore’s depiction of the so-called “agrarian idealism” of Eastern European farm life as glorifying feudalism."
