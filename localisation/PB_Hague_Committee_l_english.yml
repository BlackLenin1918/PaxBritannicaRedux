hague.1.t:0 "Hague Committe Proposal - International Court System"
hague.1.d:0 "A proposal was brought before the Hague Committee today intended to establish an international criminal court system. Within this system, members of the Courts would be subject to a human rights mandate, allowing an international bipartisan tribunal to try individuals accused of particularly heinous crimes on the battlefield. Ratifying the proposal would increase our stability significantly, but would also make us much slower to mobilize and encourage the peace movement at home."
hague.1.a:0 "We agree to ratify the proposal"
hague.1.b:0 "We refuse to ratify te proposal"

hague.2.t:0 "Hague Committe Proposal - International Banking System"
hague.2.d:0 "A proposal has been brought before the Hague Committee to establish an International Banking Fund. In the wake of the financial crisis in Britain, which itself has caused shockwaves throughout the world, the fund would help to mitigate damage caused by financial crises. Additionally, it would allow for a loan system to assist nations in their various projects. Given the damage the London Stock Crisis caused and continues to cause even now, economic decentralization and lessening support on London might be for the best."
hague.2.a:0 "We agree to ratify the proposal"
hague.2.b:0 "We refuse to ratify te proposal"

hague.3.t:0 "Hague Committe Proposal - International Research Programme"
hague.3.d:0 'A proposal has been brought before the Hague Committee to establish an International Research Programme. The Programme would give member states access to the research of other member states, and would improve our capacity to research various technologies. Additionally, such a programme might assist with the modernization of states that might not have access to.'
hague.3.a:0 "We agree to ratify the proposal"
hague.3.b:0 "We refuse to ratify te proposal"
