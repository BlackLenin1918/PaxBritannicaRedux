# THE SLUMP EVENTS
######################
slump.1.t:0 "The Stock Crisis hits the Commonwealth"
slump.1.d:0 "A sudden panic at the London Stock Exchange has spiraled out of control in the home isles. Reports have already come in that Britain proper is in the midst of a massive economic collapse. Several major companies have already folded, and it seems the so-called “Slump” has arrived in our nation as well. The Commonwealth economy, whose interconnected nature was once its strength, has now become its weakness. Large-scale unemployment is rapidly becoming an issue, and with that many radical groups have begun to come out of the woodwork. We need to work quickly to combat this crisis, or there may not be much of a government left to pick up the pieces."
slump.1.a:0 "This is bad."

slump.2.t:0 "The Stock Crisis hits Austria"
slump.2.d:0 "The Stock Crisis in London has hit Vienna. Many English companies have pulled their investments, leading to widespread unemployment virtually overnight. Despite our best efforts, this has lead to quite a bit of political instability, as voices of treason have begun to come out of the woodwork to criticize the Reich’s economic policies. An emergency meeting of the Vienna Council is already underway to establish an immediate recovery plan."
slump.2.a:0 "We should begin recovery work immediately"

slump.3.t:0 "The Great Slump hits China"
slump.3.d:0 "The Stock Crisis has hit China. In London, the bursting of the Credit bubble has caused a near total collapse of the world economy. We’ve been hit even harder than the British, as most of the foreign investors our economy relied on have pulled out of China. Unemployment has skyrocketed virtually overnight, and the CPC is already campaigning in the streets and garnering a distressing amount of support. If we don’t handle this, and soon, we’re going to have more problems than just lost investments."
slump.3.a:0 "Oh...oh dear."

slump.4.t:0 "The Chinese Economy Collapses"
slump.4.d:0 "The Chinese economy has gone into total free fall, as foreign investors have pulled their investments from the nation in the wake of the Great Slump. With this, dozens of major employers have gone under and left millions out of a job. Both the communists and the ultranationalists have seized on the situation, with Wang Jingwei and Li Lisan both campaigning in their respective voter bases. Most believe that the radical groups will use the collapse as a springboard to gain seats in the Yuan in the next election. China has been dealt a heavy blow today, and now the Yuan must try and put the pieces back together again."
slump.4.a:0 "That's, uh, that's unfortunate."

slump.5.t:0 "The Crisis hits France"
slump.5.d:0 "The shockwaves of the economic crisis have utterly decimated France. While we had little stake in the protectionist economy of Britain, the surge in panic withdrawls since the news has lead to several major banks going under. The economic depression has plunged even further into a full blown crisis, and we are dangerously in the red. \n\n With the loss of some significant investments from UK-based companies, our economy has collapsed almost entirely overnight. In many major cities, homelessness and poverty have lead to sparks between the police and citizens. It seems that mass political radicalization is all but inevitable."
slump.5.a:0 "This is terrible!"
