 PER_Anglo_Iran_Oil:0 "The Anglo-Persian Oil Company"
 PER_Anglo_Iran_Oil_desc:0 "Established as a joint-venture between the British Empire and the Persian government, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has become one of the largest corporations in the nation. This is not without struggle, however. Acting as a glorified proxy of London’s authority, the APOC has begun to increasingly assert it’s authority over the Shah’s government. With Iran being one of London’s main sources of oil, attempting to deal with the APOC could provoke a military or economic intervention."
 PER_Unpopular_Government:0 "Unpopular Regime"
 PER_Unpopular_Government_desc:0 "The Shah’s government has acted as a glorified proxy of British interests for years. This state of affairs has fostered great political discontent, particularly among Iranian nationalists and communists, who wish to see the Shah either assert his authority or removed from power entirely, respectively."
