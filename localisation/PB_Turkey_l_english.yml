 turkey_fl.1.t:0 "The Ottoman State in 1936"
 turkey_fl.1.d:0 "" #lel
 turkey_fl.1.a:0 "Sultan'a şükür, Allah'a şükür!"
 turkey_fl.2.t:0 "Sultan Abdulmecid II Dies at 76"
 turkey_fl.2.d:0 "Today, [TUR.GetNameDef] has announced the death of its sultan, who died seemingly of natural causes in his palace in [TUR.GetCapital]. A royal funeral is planned for him, while his son will soon take his place, who will be crowned as Sultan Ahmed IV."
 turkey_fl.2.a:0 "May he rest in peace."
 turkey_fl.3.t:0 "Kurdish Militants Declare Independence"
 turkey_fl.3.d:0 "This morning, word arrived that Kurdish militants have risen in rebellion against [TUR.GetNameDef], seeking to establish their own state. Their uprising, possibly sponsored by foreign agents much like the Arab revolt of the Great War, could prove to be a massive thorn in the Turks' side, disrupting logistics deep within [TUR.GetAdjective] territory."
 turkey_fl.3.a:0 "Another nation to be seated at INTERCOM, perhaps."
 turkey_fl.4.t:0 "African Immigration to [TUR.GetNameDef] Skyrockets"
 turkey_fl.4.d:0 "Foreign observers have noted that African migration to [TUR.GetNameDef] has risen significantly, in no small part to the recent voyages of many Turkish imams to Sub-Saharan Africa, seeking to spread the word of Islam. Wary analysts warn that the African migrants may very well be undergoing training to serve the [TUR.GetAdjective] army in its territorial ambitions."
 turkey_fl.4.a:0 "The growing [TUR.GetAdjective] influence in the region is concerning."
 turkey_fl.6.t:0 "The [TUR.GetAdjective] Government Reforms the Turkish Alphabet"
 turkey_fl.6.d:0 "The [TUR.GetAdjective] government has released a document detailing the total reform of the Turkish alphabet, switching the script from Arabic, ill-suited to properly interpret the unique phonology of the Turkish language, to the Latin script, whose modular features will allow Turkish words and sounds to be more easily conveyed in writing. The move is expected to significantly raise literacy rates in [TUR.GetNameDef]."
 turkey_fl.6.a:0 "This will hopefully lead to a wiser society."
 turkey_fl.7.t:0 "[TUR.GetLeader] Meets with Shi'a Ayatollahs"
 turkey_fl.7.d:0 "Today, [TUR.GetLeader] met in Antalya with a number of Ayatollahs of the Shi'a faith from the Azerbaijan region, controlled by Russia and Iran, to jumpstart inter-sect dialogue and encourage an attitude of understanding and acceptance between Shi'a and Sunni Muslims. The move is seen as part of [TUR.GetLeader]'s push to unify Muslims under the [TUR.GetAdjective] banner."
 turkey_fl.7.a:0 "A net benefit for the Islamic world."
 turkey_fl.8.t:0 "The Remilitarization of Istanbul"
 turkey_fl.8.d:0 "[TUR.GetNameDef] has stationed troops in the city of Istanbul, close to the Greek border, in clear violation of the Treaty of Lausanne. The local population cheered the [TUR.GetAdjective] soldiers on, while the diplomatic reactions from France and Britain have so far been muted."
 turkey_fl.8.a:0 "It is no more than the Turks walking into their own backyard."
 turkey_fl.9.t:0 "[TUR.GetNameDef] Goes to War!"
 turkey_fl.9.d:0 "Today, [TUR.GetNameDef] has begun offensive military actions against [FROM.GetNameDef], bringing the two countries to war with one another."
 turkey_fl.9.a:0 "So another war of aggression begins."

 turkey_fd.4.t:0 "[TUR.GetNameDef] Proposes a Closer Partnership"

 turkey_fd.4.b:0 "The research partnership will be benificial."

 turkey_fd.9.t:0 "[TUR.GetNameDef] Demands Cooperation"
 turkey_fd.9.d:0 "Our former overlords have returned, demanding that we submit to their rule once more. The Turks claim that under their rule, we will be able to reunite with our North African brethren."
 turkey_fd.9.a:0 "We must abide by their wishes for our own good."
 turkey_fd.9.b:0 "We do not answer to any foreign aggressor!"
 turkey_fd.10.t:0 "[TUR.GetNameDef] Demands the Cessation of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Coast"

 turkey_fd.10.b:0 "The Turks will never hold Iranian soil!"
 turkey_fd.11.t:0 "Iran Agrees to Cede its Coast"

 turkey_fd.12.d:0 "The Persian leadership has rejected our demands, refusing to cede the territory we have demanded."

 #descriptions
 TUR_coup_desc:0 "In Izmir, the government of Inonu will gather to discuss the future of the Sultan. Some wish to grant him absolute power- others wish to restrict his power further."
 TUR_auth_desc:0 "With Inonu and his supporters still firmly in power, the Ottoman State will be guided towards regional dominance once more, without the pesky Sultan interfering."
 TUR_absolutism_desc:0 "With Sultan Abdulmecid II in absolute power once more, we must seek to restore the former pride and glory of the Ottoman Empire."
 TUR_turanism_desc:0 "With Nihal Atsiz and his followers firmly in control, the nation of Turkey will finally be able to fulfill its destiny as the commander of the fate of the Turkic peoples as a whole."
 TUR_step_one_desc:0 "The first nation in our path is naturally Iraq, the Arab kingdom to our south. They will bend the knee and serve as the example for future opponents."
 TUR_push_south_desc:0 "With Iraq under our thumb, we must push farther south. The Arabian penninsula was our once, and will be ours once more."
 TUR_arab_rapproachment_desc:0 "The Arab Rebellion was nearly the undoing of our empire outright. We must work to restore Turkish-Arabic relations to ensure they do not throw this calamity on us once again."
 TUR_arab_infrastructure_desc:0 "Dedicating resources to the construction of roads and railroads in the Arabian penninsula will both further instill trust in the local populace, and help support future wartime operations in the region."
 TUR_arab_oil_desc:0 "Oil reserves recently discovered by the Sauds have proven to me much more massive than expected. Tapping these reserves will prove to be a boon to our military efforts and our economy."
 TUR_coerce_libya_desc:0 "King Idris is a troubled leader and unpredictable. But his lands hold strategic value in serving as a gateway to Africa that will bypass the British. An ultimatum to him will convince him to join us- or warn of the consequences."
 TUR_libya_naval_desc:0 "With Libya secured, we must further build up our presence, in the form of naval bases to support our revitalized naval forces."
 TUR_african_recruitment_desc:0 "Through Libya, we can send intellectuals carrying the words of Allah and the Sultan to the peoples of Africa, where young men ready to lay their lives for the faith will be convinced to flock to us in droves."
 TUR_reclaim_palestine_desc:0 "The holy city of al-Quds lies within our reach, but is nonetheless under the guns of the British Empire. Taking this vital city will awaken the lion- but we will be ready for him."
 TUR_holy_land_desc:0 "One of the last strongholds of Arab Nationalism is along the coast of the Red Sea- and this last kingdom holds the holiest city known to mankind. We are the legitimate government- the Caliphate of Islam- and that city belongs to us."
 TUR_priv_sec_desc:0 "Our country has the potential for growth while everyone else stumbles. Trusting the citizenry is vital to a natural growth of the economy."
 TUR_nationalize_biz_desc:0 "The key to rapid growth of the economy lies in hard control by the government- they know best and will be able to push the economy upward at the rate it needs."
 TUR_negot_aus_desc:0 "Austria, our longtime rival, is taking the initiative in reclaiming their former glory in the faces of the victorious powers of the Great War. We must ensure we maintain a stable partnership with them if we are to do the same."
 TUR_indoctrination_desc:0 "The public is still wary of the changes taking place around them. We must work to show them how these changes are good for them and for the nation at large."
 TUR_latinization_desc:0 "The Arabic script is wholly ill-suited to the Turkish language. Replacing it with a latin-based script will simplify our writing system and allow us to raise literacy rates significantly."
 TUR_reconciliation_desc:0 "The Sunni-Shia split in Islam has been disastrous for Islam as a whole, producing unneeded conflict among brothers of the Faith. While we cannot undo the division, we can seek to reach peace with the Shias, and rally them to our cause."
 TUR_airbase_expand_desc:0 "Air power will be crucial in securing our army's advance in their inevitable march through the Caucasus. Expanding existing facilities in Trabzon will be crucial in securing the skies."

 TUR_northwest_infra_desc:0 "As war with Russia becomes more and more inevitable, it is clear we need to continue building up the region to ensure we can support logistics in the region."
 TUR_crimea_incursion_desc:0 "Ukraine is a weak nation, and the Crimean penninsula is a strategic location to hold in the Black Sea. We must take this penninsula to secure the strategic location before Russia does, and to liberate the local Tatar populace."
 TUR_pan_turkism_desc:0 "The realization of Pan-Turkism is the destiny of our new Turkey. The public must be made aware of this."
 TUR_confront_shah_desc:0 "The road to Turkestan is blocked by the Shahdom of Iran. Without a route along the Caspian, we will not be able to unite our Turkic brethren in the east."
 TUR_going_east_desc:0 "With our path to Turkestan secure, we must now topple the nations of old which occupy the Turkic plains."
 TUR_panturk_union_desc:0 "A Pan-Turkic union spanning Asia is no longer our future- it is our reality."
 TUR_strike_north_desc:0 "Russia serves both as a prison for the remaining Turkic populace and as our primary opponent for regional dominace. The Slavs do not own these steppes- we do. Let us show them."
 TUR_industry_roots_desc:0 "The Ottoman Empire, for some time, lagged behind the rest of Europe in terms of industrial output. No longer."
 TUR_reform_tia_desc:0 "The TiA company is our premier arms manufacturer, but suffers from outdated practices and organization. Reforming the supplying company is essential to maintaining a modern military."

 TUR_tactical_innovation_desc:0 "Modern technological advances necessitate modern tactics to complement them. We must continue to study and improve our military's doctrines."
 TUR_naval_investment_desc:0 "The sea can be both our greatest ally and foe. A large navy will let us control the nearby waters, and make us the ruling power in any conflict in the area."
 TUR_standardize_arms_desc:0 "Standardizing our infantry equipment will enable us to ease our logistics and make them more efficient."
 TUR_operational_level_desc:0 "Operational-level battleplanning is the key middle-point between war strategy and battle tactics. Pioneering knowledge in this field will give us an edge over our enemy."
 TUR_light_navy_focus_desc:0 "A navy of many light ships will let us swarm opposing navies and lose comparatively little materiel per ship sunk."

 TUR_kemal_class_desc:0 "The Suleiman-Class aircraft carrier is a concept that will allow us to project air power right within our fleet groups with little to no warning needed."
 TUR_naval_drilling_desc:0 "The DHO, Turkey's primary naval school, must be expanded to enable better training of greater numbers of students. Doing so will let us train more sailors in specialized tactics."
 TUR_rocketry_desc:0 "Rocketry is a field being pioneered by the west, giving them a potential edge in aircraft and weapons development. We too must research and develop these engines."
 TUR_nuke_desc:0 "Nuclear scientists speak of a weapon that is capable of leveling entire cities in an instant. This is the power one would expect only from God himself- but if we have the potential to wield it for ourselves, then wield it we must."
 TUR_dockyard_desc:0 "To support our burdgeoning navy, we need to modernize and expand our shipyards, the womb of our navy."
 TUR_remilitarize_desc:0 "The city of Istanbul lies within range of Greek Artillery, and military access to it is barred. The city itself is wholly defenseless. Let us cast aside that wretched paper that forbids us to defend our greatest city."
 TUR_istanbul_bridge:0 "A massive bridge over the Bosphorous straight will connect the two halves of Istanbul like never before. It will benefit the economy of the city and the image of Turkey internationally. It will also be essential in supplying the European side of Istanbul in the event of war."
 TUR_fortify_coast:0 "As Greece becomes more hostile to us, we must ensure they do not attempt an invasion of us through their islands. An emergency initiative to fortify key landing grounds along our coast will prevent Greek troops from setting foot in Anatolia."
 TUR_maritime_drilling:0 "The Aegean Sea, with it's thousands of islands, is a unique battlefield for soldiers and ships alike. Special training must be undertaken to ensure we remain prepared to fight in such an environment."
 TUR_demand_thrace:0 "The region of Thrace belongs to us. If the Greeks do not hand the islands over, we will take them by force."
