  PB_TUR_Iron_Fist:0 "The Iron Fist of Izzet"
  PB_TUR_Iron_Fist_desc:0 "General Ahmed Izzet Pasha took power in 1925 as an “emergency” leader, but his provisional dictatorship has remained in power since. Izzet’s strong grip over the country is still felt, even in 1933, despite his failing health and increasing inability to control national politics."
  PB_TUR_Vestigial_Empire:0 "Vestigial Empire"
  PB_TUR_Vestigial_Empire_desc:0 "The Ottomans are an empire in name only, with the only real remnants being in portions of Syria and Kurdistan. Rampant corruption, poverty and political instability grow like wildfire in the country. Though the Caliph still remains, his power is solely dictated by the military junta."
  PB_TUR_Economic_Collapse:0 "Total Economic Collapse"
  PB_TUR_Economic_Collapse_desc:0 "The Ottoman economy has been in a state of near total collapse for years, thanks in part to the global economic downturn and the mismanagement of the Arab revolt. Foreign investment is nonexistent, and very few can afford anything beyond the most basic necessities"
  PB_TUR_Caliph_of_Islam:0 "The Caliph of Islam"
  PB_TUR_Caliph_of_Islam_desc:0 "Despite a myriad of social, economic and political problems, the Ottoman Caliph still remains the de-facto head of the Islamic faith. This legitimacy is one of the few sinews holding Turkish society together, however the Ottoman loss of the Islamic holy sites in Arabia was a massive blow to the religious legitimacy of the Caliph. It is not uncommon for many Muslims abroad to look to Istanbul for guidance, but many have begun to turn their attention towards those who hold Mecca, the Arabians."
