surrender.1.t:0 "The Loss of the West"
surrender.1.d:0 "Our army has been pushed back past the Urals, and morale is at an all time low. Several members of our administration have suggested that we seek peace terms with the enemy, even if it means that we will lose our western territories."
surrender.1.a:0 "Seek peace terms."
surrender.1.b:0 "Russia will never be defeated!"

surrender.2.t:0 "Russia proposes Peace Terms"
surrender.2.d:0 "Having been pushed past the Ural mountain range, the Russian government has proposed peace terms to us. They will cede us any lands west of the Urals in exchange for a peace agreement. Should we continue fighting or take the deal?"
surrender.2.a:0 "A fine conquest."
surrender.2.b:0 "Peace? No peace!"

surrender.3.t:0 "Our peace terms are rejected!"
surrender.3.d:0 "Our peace terms have been rejected. The war continues."
surrender.3.a:0 "To the bitter end, then."

surrender.4.t:0 "The Fall of Britain"
surrender.4.d:0 "Britain has fallen. In the streets and cities, enemy troops now occupy vast swathes of our homeland. The event that has been feared since 1066 has finally come to pass. With London in enemy hands, we have little choice but to flee abroad and seek exile, continuing the war effort from our dominions abroad. \n\n Britain may fall today, but we shall return."
surrender.4.a:0 "The Government flees in exile to Canada"
surrender.4.b:0 "Nowhere left to run..."

surrender.5.t:0 "Exiles from Britain"
surrender.5.d:0 "The London government has fallen, and much of Great Britain proper has come under occupation by enemy forces. With the end of a central British authority, millions have fled the Isles for Dominions abroad in exile. Among those arriving at our shores are former members of the Royal Family and elements of the former British parliament. \n\n The Empire has already begun to come apart at the seams without centralized leadership, and the Exiles have requested to take command of the Canadian government until the Home Isles can be liberated from occupation. Naturally, much of the Canadian left has opposed the idea, stating that despite our responsibilities to the King-Emperor, we should not give up Canadian national sovereignty on a “fool’s errand.”"
surrender.5.a:0 "The Exiles assume direct control of the government."
surrender.5.b:0 "No! We will never be imperial lapdogs!"

surrender.6.t:0 "Britain has fallen, Looking to the Future"
surrender.6.d:0 "The British government has collapsed, leaving the empire without centralized leadership and totally disorganizing the Dominions. Without the London government to enforce colonial rule, many local leaders have begun demanding Dominion independence, often clashing with loyalist forces. In order to prevent mass civil unrest, we must make a decision. \n\n Do we strike for our independence, or do we maintain loyalty to the crown?"
surrender.6.a:0 "Declare independence"
surrender.6.b:0 "Maintain loyalty to the Crown"

surrender.7.t:0 "Continuing the Struggle"
surrender.7.d:0 "Our exile in Canada is, at least for now, somewhat secured. This brings us to the larger matter of deciding on the future. Much of the government supports continuing the struggle against the British occupation, believing that we should completely nationalize Canadian industry to retake the Home Isles. Others believe we should bide our time for now and focus on developing Canada long term for the eventual reclamation of Britain."
surrender.7.a:0 "We shall never surrender!"
surrender.7.b:0 "Accept the bitter peace. For now."

surrender.8.t:0 "Our ally has fallen"
surrender.8.d:0 "One of our major allies on the continent has fallen. Without them, our chances of winning the war are significantly reduced. Should we pursue a white peace with the enemy, or continue the fight?"
surrender.8.a:0 "Offer peace terms to the enemy"
surrender.8.b:0 "No surrender! No peace!"

surrender.9.t:0 "Britain offers peace"
surrender.9.d:0 "Britain, a major enemy in our war, has offered a white peace with our nation after we have defeated one of their major allies. How shall we proceed?"
surrender.9.a:0 "Agree to a white peace."
surrender.9.b:0 "No peace."
