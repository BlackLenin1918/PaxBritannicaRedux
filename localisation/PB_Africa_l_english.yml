  africa.1.t:0 "The Mali Federation declares Independence"
  africa.1.d:0 "With the defeat of the French colonialists, many individuals within the former Mali Empire have been openly seeking independence from our occupation. This situation has come to a head as Modibo Keïta, head of the Mali Socialist Party, seized control of several major cities throughout Mali with the support of sympathetic paramilitaries. \n\n Declaring the “Mali Federation” before an apathetic crowd, Keïta’s declaration is a direct threat to our new government, and many in the military believe we should intervene directly to destroy the new nation before things get out of hand."
  africa.1.a:0 "Let them go."
  africa.1.b:0 "This will not stand!"

  africa.2.t:0 "Demand Southern Mali?"
  africa.2.d:0 "In the chaos of the African Revolutions, it seems Southern Mali slipped away into the occupation of another nation. Given our newfound peace and independence, what better way to supplement peace but with another war? We should demand our rightful lands, and unite all the Mali peoples under one flag."
  africa.2.a:0 "It is our rightful land!"
  africa.2.b:0 "We are not in the position to make demands."

  africa.3.t:0 "The Collapse of French Africa"
  africa.3.d:0 "For what felt like an eternity, Ethiopia stood as the only truly independent nation in Africa. Now, however, it seems the tide has begun to turn against the Europeans. In a matter of weeks, without the support of Paris, French Africa has detonated into a menagerie of new states. With the French in no position to take them back and Europe largely concerned with its own affairs, perhaps now might be the time to revive pan-african sentiment? \n\n The proposed plan is rather simple. The formation of an African National Congress, which will work to promote African values and nationalism throughout member states. Under this banner, we can begin to stir anti-imperial sentiments and, hopefully, ultimately liberate our fellow Africans from the control of the European powers."
  africa.3.a:0 "What better time than now?"
  africa.3.b:0 "No, not now."

  africa.4.t:0 "The First African National Congress"
  africa.4.d:0 "We have been invited to a meeting in Addis Abada by the Emperor of Ethiopia. Speaking before the collected delegates, Emperor Selassie has proposed an “African National Congress” akin to INC in British India. Under Selassie’s proposal, constituent nations of the ANC would work for the mutual benefit of the African peoples, particularly in the crusade against the European powers. \n\n By joining the ANC, we would be able to pool whatever resources our nations have. Additionally, we could begin working to modernize the infrastructure left behind by the Europeans. While the ANC has many benefits, there are concerns it might undermine our newfound sovereignty."
  africa.4.a:0 "Elect to join the ANC"
  africa.4.b:0 "We're not interested."

  africa.5.t:0 "Violence in Nigeria"
  africa.5.d:0 "As revolutionary fervor sweeps across Africa, the violence has spilled over into British Nigeria. Anti-British riots have broken out in towns near the border with the newly formed African states, and colonial officials have raised concerns that the violence may spread throughout the region if not handled properly."
  africa.5.a:0 "Send some troops to quell the riots."

  africa.6.t:0 "The African Unrest Spreads"
  africa.6.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, the revolutionary fervor in Africa has spread beyond just Nigeria. Reports have come in that revolutionaries have begun actively operating as far as Uganda and Tanganyika. Low-intensity guerilla warfare has begun to break out throughout the African colonies. If we intend to end this uprising, we need to either take more extreme measures, or begin working to establish some degree of African home rule to quell the uprisings."
  africa.6.a:0 "It seems more exteme measures might be necessary."
