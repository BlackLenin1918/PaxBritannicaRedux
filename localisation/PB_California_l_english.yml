  PB_CAL_Revolutionary_Legacy:0 "Legacy of the Revolution"
  PB_CAL_Revolutionary_Legacy_desc:0 "The Republic of California was born in a blaze of violence out of the Northern Revolution. With the fatherland in the South unable to even save itself, it fell to the revolutionaries in the North to protect the Nortemexicanos. Even decades later, the embers of the revolution still burn just as brightly as they once did. If the time comes and the Empire returns to take back what they believe is theirs, the people of California will be ready."
  PB_CAL_Oil_Boom:0 "The California Oil Boom"
  PB_CAL_Oil_Boom_desc:0 "Alongside Tejas, California is a major exporter of oil in North America. Coupled with strong trade relations with Europe and the Great Powers, California has carved out an extremely profitable oil industry. In the last decade, this has prompted a full blown oil boom as investors flock to California and Tejas in the wake of European downturn, with new facilities popping up all the time and creating millions of jobs."
  PB_CAL_California_Agriculture:0 "Californian Agriculture"
  PB_CAL_California_Agriculture_desc:0 "California is, indisputably, one of the most dominant agricultural powers in the Americas. Alone, the citrus and fruits industries employ nearly a third of the nation's job-holders. Everything from strawberries and almonds to grapes and lemons are exported from the green fields of California. In practical terms, this means that California holds a natural economic dominance over certain aspects of American trade."
  PB_CAL_Dreams_of_Unification:0 "Dreams of Unification"
  PB_CAL_Dreams_of_Unification_desc:0 "During the Northern Revolution, proposals were on the table to unify the disparate Mexican states into a single government. At the time, these ideas were shelved for the sake of revolutionary cohesion. Now, however, there is an overwhelming sense among Californians that the time for true unification has come. With the fatherland nearing collapse and the likelihood of a North American war in the future, California seeks to bring together the hispanic peoples of the former Mexican Empire once more into a United State."
   PB_TEX_Between_Giants:0 "A Republic Between Giants"
   PB_TEX_Between_Giants_desc:0 "Even before the Northern Revolution, Tejas had been divided between Mexicans and Americans, and the British and Spanish. Now, it finds itself still divided among political, racial, and foreign lines. The American Commonwealth to the east sits as the British-backed hegemon, while the Empire to the south lurks, waiting for an opportunity to strike at Tejas's freedom. While this nationalistic fervor will ensure our country is never seized by imperialists, racial and political tensions only further divide our nation..."
 PB_TEX_The_Texan_Boom:0 "Economic Boom"
 PB_TEX_The_Texan_Boom_desc:0 "Tejas has emerged as one of the most economically stable nations in the American continent. With a business friendly government, a stable democracy (at least on the surface), and an ample coastline, Tejas has found itself the subject of foreign investment and cross-continental trade. In addition, cooperation with the American Commonwealth and the British Empire, despite large-scale economic stagnation in both nations, have entrenched our prosperity with some of the greatest powers in the world."
 PB_TEX_pragmatic_president:0 "The Pragmatic President"
 PB_TEX_pragmatic_president_desc:0 "With all the racial tensions facing Tejas, President Adolfo de la Huerta has toed the line between Tejano and Anglo, and pushed forward numerous reforms to heal the divides facing Tejas. However, despite all the compromises made by de la Huerta's government, not much substantive reform has actually gone through, and tensions are still as high as ever. For every speech de la Huerta makes announcing renewed prosperity in Tejas, more violence occurs in the frontier. Something must be done, but is de la Huerta brave enough to act?"
PB_TEX_the_settler_conflict:0 "Tejano-Anglo Tensions"
PB_TEX_the_settler_conflict_desc:0 "The settler conflict has been eating away at our nation for years, and the collapse of the Mexican Empire has only made it worse. Widespread economic collapse in the American Commonwealth has led to a massive immigration wave from Anglos in the East, while Mexicans in the south flee to our stable democracy. Enclaves divided among racial lines have only become more common with our increasing political polarization."
