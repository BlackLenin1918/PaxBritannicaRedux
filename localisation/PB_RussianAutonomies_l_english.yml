  PB_BAL_Denikin_Playground:0 "Denikin's Playground"
  PB_BAL_Denikin_Playground_desc:0 "The horrors that occur in the Baltic Governate cannot be described with words. The souls that inhabit the region are broken beyond repair, Denikin and his grunts abuse their power on levels even Moscow would blink an eye at. Yet the Tsar is complacent, afterall Denikin is effective at his job; silencing any opposition that can be found in the Baltics.\n\nBeing the most Russified Givernate of all of Russia's autonomies the Baltic people know their time for 'nominal' independce is soon to be over. New Russian communities have already largely replaced urban centers and the only areas that still house a majority ethnic baltic population are undeveloped rural towns."
  PB_FIN_Winter_War:0 "The Winter War"
  PB_FIN_Winter_War_desc:0 "The Finnish revolt of 1931 has been a thorn in Russia's administrative efforts in controlling the region, officially governed by the Russian Empire in reality the northern regions are effectively under the command of rag-tag Finnish seperatists. That and their continued support from Scandanavian nations, namely Sweden, has pro-longed this 'winter' guerilla campaign longer than expected. Tank combat is rendered effectively useless because of Finlands terrain with Russian tactics now boiling down to 'send as many men as we can' to drive the Free Finnish Army out. With already 5,000 Russian deaths compared to a measly 300 Finnish deaths the demands for peace become louder in Moscow."
  PB_FIN_Scandinavian_Support:0 "Scandinavian Support"
  PB_FIN_Scandinavian_Support_desc:0 "The military support the Free Finnish Army recieves from Sweden is vital to their secessionist cause. In fact almost all Finnish weapons are of Swedish origin with only a hand full of weapons being produced locally, if funding was to be some how cut then Finland as a concept would die within a heart beat. Sweden and the rest of Scandanavia provide Finland with military know-how in the form of secret attaches, of course the Scandanavian nations are mostly sending military proffesionals in the hopes of improving their own army, and not out of the goodness of their hearts. Although all can agree it would be better if Russia wasn't knocking on their doorstep."
  PB_ASK_Political_Melting_Pot:0 "Political Melting Pot"
  PB_ASK_Political_Melting_Pot_desc:0 "The convicts that litter Novorossiya all harbour different, and rather extremist political views. Jacobins, Liberals, Conservatives, and even some Far-right individuals call the colony of New Russia home. Although the prisons are divided along political views with gangs even being formed along shared ideological beliefs one thing all prisones want is to break free from the very shackles Moscow has forced upon them."
  PB_ASK_Prison_State:0 "Prison State"
  PB_ASK_Prison_State_desc:0 "Every week a new shipment of political deviants and social degenerates arrive in the city of Novo-Arkhangelsk. Sent by Moscow in hopes of ridding Russia of 'unpure' thoughts. As a result the colony of New Russia has become a compilacated mess to govern, the local settlers fervently hate the influx of prisons that have sprouted across the land whilst the officers that are employed in said prisons tend to be uncaringly corrupt. Often letting prisoners buy their way to freedom, for a hefty price of course. In reality the prison state is nothing less than a get-together party with Russia's most vibrant minds. "
  PB_FIN_Unpopular_Administration:0 "Unpopular Administration"
  PB_FIN_Unpopular_Administration_desc:0 "The intrusion of Russian affairs into Finland hasn't been met with positive reception. Whilst not unique to Finland as all Russia's autonomies wish for the bear to let go in Finlands case the situation is arguably worse due to the continued partisan campaign by the Free Finnish Army. The people know that there is hope for independence and it is because of this that they will do everything in their power to fight Moscow. Though there is a clear remedy to this issue, end the Finnish partisan threat and the people will in time loose hope."
  PB_BAL_Forest_Brothers:0 "Forest Brothers"
  PB_BAL_Forest_Brothers_desc:0 "With Denikin's goons targeting ethnic Balts and German minorities it has come to no surprise to Moscow that resitance groups have formed to counter the Russian funded savages. Nicknamed the Forest Brothers, the resistance group is mainly made up of Ethnic balts, the majority of which are Estonian. Acting as a sort of peoples militia that respond to calls for help the Forest Brothers are an effective and ready partisan group and remain as the only armed presence that can counter Denikin's roaming hit squads."
  PB_TRS_Caucasus_Resorts:0 "Resorts In Caucasia"
  PB_TRS_Caucasus_Resorts_desc:0 "The resorts that can be found in Caucasia are nothing short of amazing. Every year during the summer months thousands of rich aristocrats and business men vacate to the Caucasus to find time to breathe and relax. Here anything from prostitution to mind-bending drugs can be found and no one blinks an eye. Moscow knows of the situation but the profits that are made in the summer months are too good to missout on. "
