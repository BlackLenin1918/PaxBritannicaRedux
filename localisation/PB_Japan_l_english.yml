  PB_JAP_Republican_Terror_Legacy:0 "Legacy of the Republican Terror"
  PB_JAP_Republican_Terror_Legacy_desc:0 "The Purges that followed Japan’s revolution still torment many in the Republic, and thousands still remain imprisoned. Hashimoto’s regime has divided much of the Japanese populace, with some seeing him as their protector against reactionaries and others seeing him as little better than the Emperor."
  PB_JAP_Sakurakai:0 "The Sakurakai"
  PB_JAP_Sakurakai_desc:0 "	Whispers abound in smokey back rooms of a society dedicated to a return to the revolutionary principles that Hashimoto betrayed. Formed of an alliance of disenchanted lefitsts, this so-called Cherry Blossom Society seeks to overthrow the Hashimoto government and create a more democratic Japan."
  PB_JAP_Reactionary_Plot:0 "Reactionary Plot?"
  PB_JAP_Reactionary_Plot_desc:0 "Despite the Imperial government being overthrown more than a decade ago, there are still some that harbor sentiments with the Emperor. Should enough chaos erupt in the Republic, such elements in our society may seek to reinstate the old Imperial family."
