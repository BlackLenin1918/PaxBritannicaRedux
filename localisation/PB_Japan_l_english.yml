  PB_JAP_Republican_Terror_Legacy_desc:0 "The Purges that followed Japan’s revolution still torment many in the Republic, and thousands still remain imprisoned. Hashimoto’s regime has divided much of the Japanese populace, with some seeing him as their protector against reactionaries and others seeing him as little better than the Emperor."
  PB_JAP_Sakurakai:0 "The Sakurakai"
  PB_JAP_Sakurakai_desc:0 "	Whispers abound in smokey back rooms of a society dedicated to a return to the revolutionary principles that Hashimoto betrayed. Formed of an alliance of disenchanted lefitsts, this so-called Cherry Blossom Society seeks to overthrow the Hashimoto government and create a more democratic Japan."
  PB_JAP_Reactionary_Plot:0 "Reactionary Plot?"
  PB_JAP_Reactionary_Plot_desc:0 "Despite the Imperial government being overthrown more than a decade ago, there are still some that harbor sentiments with the Emperor. Should enough chaos erupt in the Republic, such elements in our society may seek to reinstate the old Imperial family."

  PB_JAP_Sakurakai_Plot:0 "The Secret War"
  PB_JAP_Sakurakai_Plot_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has become abundantly clear that reactionaries are now operating in Japan and attempting to undo the Revolution we fought so hard to achieve. The assassination attempt on Kingoro Hashimoto, Grand Protector of the Japanese Revolution, has revealed the hand of these perfidious forces. If we are to preserve the Japanese way of life and our Republic, these forces must be eliminated.\n\nThe Current Plot Power of the Sakurakai is at §Y[?JAP.Sakurakai_Plot_Power]%§!\n\nThe Current Level of Suspicion against the Sakurakai is at §Y[?JAP.Sakurakai_Suspicion]%§!\n\n[GET_ISHII_STATUS]\n\n[GET_NAGANO_STATUS]\n\n[GET_NOSAKA_STATUS]\n\n[GET_OKAWA_STATUS]\n\n§YThe Coup will happen at the conclusion of the timer. In order to succeed, the Coup's Plot Power must be above 50% and Suspicion below 50%, and any pro-Hardliner individuals in the government must be eliminated. In order to prevent the coup, Plot Power must be below 50% or Suspicion must be above 50% and all pro-reformist individuals must be removed. Failing to remove certain individuals if the coup is successful may have consequences.§!\n"
