  PB_JAP_Republican_Terror_Legacy_desc:0 "The Purges that followed Japan’s revolution still torment many in the Republic, and thousands still remain imprisoned. Hashimoto’s regime has divided much of the Japanese populace, with some seeing him as their protector against reactionaries and others seeing him as little better than the Emperor."
  PB_JAP_Sakurakai:0 "The Sakurakai"
