 japan_fl.1.t:0 "The Empire of Japan in 1936"
 japan_fl.1.d:0 "On April 4th, 1864, a Portuguese Navy expedition under the command of Admiral E.J. de Bettencourt arrived at the entrance to Edo Bay in a show of force with their revolutionary ironclad battlecruiser, the Vasco da Gama. With the Tokugawa Shogunate unable to challenge the Portuguese Navy, the so-called “Armada ao Japão” forcefully catapulted Japan out of its centuries-long policy of isolationism and into the international stage.\n\n By the conclusion of the Great War, the modernized Japan had both restored the power of her timeless monarchy, and assumed her place among the greatest of the world’s nations. The Japanese defeat of the Bolsheviks in the Russian Far East and the Spanish in the Philippines solidified Emperor Taishō as another of Japan’s great Emperors, and created a lasting feeling of national unity among the people of the Japanese Empire.\n\n Despite the glory gained in the Great War, the Japanese Empire faces troubles ahead. The military, eager to capitalize on the civil unrest in the neighboring Republic of China and to expand Japan ever further, is kept in check by the democratic government of Japan within the Japanese home islands, but rules Japan’s overseas realm with an iron fist. Irrendentist sympathies are increasing in Russia. Some within Japan wish to see the return of absolute control of His Majesty Kinjō-Heika, who himself may desire to outlast his father in the annals of time and history. Still others desire the outright dissolvement of the Chrysanthemum Throne.\n\n A storm is brewing in the heart of the Empire, and it may very well sweep the entirety of Asia..."

 #descriptions
 JAP_revitalize_desc:0 "Our populace is understandably shaken by the turn of recent events. We must remind them that no matter the circumstances we face, they are Japanese, and must exhibit the strength and fortitude of the Japanese."
 JAP_modernization_desc:0 "Our infrastructure is among the most well-developed in Asia already, but there is undoubtedly room for improvement. We must devote time and resources to the upkeep of roads, railways and buildings across the Realm."
 JAP_army_primacy_desc:0 "The technology of land warfare advances over the years, and so do the doctrines and tactics of land warfare. Japan must remain versatile if it is to keep up with the changing world of warfare."
 JAP_navy_primacy_desc:0 "The sea is the greatest defense our nation holds against foreign opponents. Every day, the enemy seeks new ways to circumvent this barrier. We must not allow them to do so."
 JAP_student_act_desc:0 "The advancement of Japan on the world stage requires that every hand participate in the effort to strengthen our nation. We must reach out to the young - the next generation."
 JAP_university_desc:0 "His Majesty decrees that the next generation of Japan must be the smartest the world has ever seen. We must invest in our universities to meet His demands, and so that the next generation will maintain the edge we gain over our foes."
 JAP_synth_oil_desc:0 "Japan is starved for oil, but not for long. New methods of oil extraction and refinement will allow us to become less reliant on untrustworthy foreign nations for the lifeblood of our empire in this mechanical age."
 JAP_military_youth_desc:0 "It is imperative that our youth be acquainted with the rich warrior history of Japan, and that when they are of age, they be able to fight for the defense of our nation, should it be necessary."
 JAP_adv_weapon_desc:0 "Our scientists are making breakthroughs into new sciences unimaginable even twenty years ago. These advances must be encouraged, and these scientists helped."
 JAP_imp_unity_desc:0 "Every heart and every soul must be dedicated to the defense of the Japanese Empire in this time of conflict and war. Our troops must be able to rest between battles knowing they have the support of their entire nation."
 JAP_propaganda_desc:0 "Some citizens may yet have reservations or questions of our nation's motives as we move into conflict with our enemies abroad. We must eliminate these doubts to secure the opinion of the populace."
 JAP_rations_desc:0 "We cannot allow our troops to lose momentum in the field. As our nation is strained of resources, the citizenry will have to reasonably sacrifice in their daily lives so our soldiers and sailors may fight on."
 JAP_waifu_desc:0 "As more and more men bid the Home Islands farewell for the frontline, factories are being emptied of their would-be laborers. Allowing women to take their place will ensure that our war machine continues to operate smoothly with the departure of their husbands."
 JAP_counterspy_desc:0 "Even in peace, but especially in war, Japan is the target of foreign spies and saboteurs. We can galvanize the mutual goodwill and trust among our citizens to uproot these infiltrators."
 JAP_army_inn_desc:0 "With turbulent and uncertain times ahead, it is of the utmost importance for our army to remain at the forefront of the world."
 JAP_honshu_desc:0 "However powerful our army is, attack on the home islands is never out of the realm of possibility. Drilling the citizenry will ensure their safety should we be faced with this unfortunate happenstance."
 JAP_fortress_japan_desc:0 "The enemy draws nearer, and so they craft their schemes to gain a foothold on the Home Islands. The beaches of our nation shall be fortified so that the enemy never makes it out of the beachwater."
 JAP_militia_desc:0 "Even those men who have stayed home must be ready to contribute to the war effort if need be. Organizing local militas may prove decisive in future engagements."
 JAP_volunteer_desc:0 "A unified militia command must be installed if we are to keep the frontlines from coming too close to our land."
 JAP_air_inn_desc:0 "The Great War saw the advent of many flying machines, and by the end of the war, they were fighting eachother in the skies. Twenty years later, air power is becoming quite possibly the most decisive factor in battle."
 JAP_naval_air_desc:0 "Air power does not stop where the land does. We must invest in shipborne aircraft in order to fully project our power over the oceans. The Yokosuka Corporation has conveniently offered to dedicate its resources to the production of such aircraft."
 JAP_divine_wind_desc:0 "Fearlessly facing the prospect of death is expected of any soldier, but our people must go beyond this, preparing to sacrifice themselves with no hope of survival for the glory of the emperor and the nation."
 JAP_cherry_blossom_desc:0 "Kamikaze, the tactics of the Special Attack Unit, have changed suicide attacks from an improvised last measure to an established doctrine. With new planes, essentially manned missiles, these attacks will be unstoppable."
 JAP_ketsu_go_desc:0 "The enemy is upon our shores, but there is hope yet for our nation. Japan has never been conquered by a foreign power - thus, every hand of the nation must take up an arm against the enemy, however large or small, to defend the honor of Japan."
 JAP_motor_desc:0 "The days of marching on foot are over. Though a great testament to the discipline and willpower of our infantry, continuing to use foot travel will result in our army being hopelessly outpowered and outmaneuvered. It is time to invest in technologies for more rapid troop placement."
 JAP_armor_desc:0 "The land machines which surfaced in the Great War have significantly developed in the decades since. These tanks are predicted to take the forefront of ground-based warfare in the years to come. Japan must not be left behind."
 JAP_special_desc:0 "No regular force, no matter how advanced or numerous, can achieve the same effect as a group of people specialized for combat in a given environment or circumstance. It will be wise to invest in the training of troops for more peculiar situations."
 JAP_strategic_desc:0 "As the war rages on, it is important to examine how we can innovate both technologies and doctrines to sway the battle at the strategic level."
 JAP_unit_731_desc:0 "The formation of a special Military Scientific Unit has been proposed to investigate the possibilities of more unorthodox weaponry."
 JAP_f_go_desc:0 "As our nuclear scientists continue to innovate, rumors spread of foreign attempts to harness and weaponize nuclear energy. This could prove to be one of the greatests "
 JAP_navy_inn_desc:0 "Japan's greatest military strength truly lies in its navy - its ability to stop any seaborne force before it can reach the Japanese Home Islands. We must invest in new technologies to keep our navy at the "
 JAP_navy_sys_desc:0 "A number of specific features of ships in the navy could be upgraded to give each vessel an edge in combat. It is imperative that we exploit these force multipliers to their fullest."
 JAP_expand_homeports_desc:0 "As our navy expands, so too must the harbors that replenish and supply them. Expanding them will keep our navy fuelled and supplied."
 JAP_shipyard_mod_desc:0 "Our shipyards run on obsolete technologies and outdated policies. Improving each will streamline and optimize our dockyards for maximum efficiency."
 JAP_navy_prog_desc:0 "The focus of our navy must be re-examined if we are to keep pace in the changing world of naval warfare. Critical testing must be done to determine the focus of our naval power."
 JAP_sub_navy_desc:0 "Our navy must focus on improving its submarine capabilities. Cutting off enemy supply and trade will be critical in starving their land forces abroad."
 JAP_carrier_navy_desc:0 "Our navy must focus on innovating in carrier technology. Projecting airpower at sea and over foreign shores will be critical in the coming years."
 JAP_battleship_navy_desc:0 "Our navy must focus on perfecting its capital ships. Powerful battleships have been the cornerstone of a powerful navy and will continue to be so for years to come."
 JAP_sentoku_desc:0 "We have received plans from one of our chief engineers for a submarine of a magnitude which have never been seen before in history. This submarine will itself be able to carry a small group of planes, as well as have a massive range and torpedo payload."
 JAP_yamato_desc:0 "It has been proposed that we resume the Yamato Battleship project. If completed, it will surely be the most powerful warship to ever venture into the sea."
 JAP_taiho_desc:0 "Prominent shipbuilders have proposed the creation of a new class of aircraft carrier, more heavily armored than any previous carrier, and with a greater carrying capacity than the others."
 JAP_nanshin_ron_desc:0 "As our Empire grows in strength, it too grows increasingly starved of resources, and we must look outward to supply our nation and people. Across the seas, the Western powers sit atop a wealth of resources. We must force our newfound strength upon the powers of the west as they face decline."
 JAP_aus_diplom_desc:0 "On the other side of the world, where our Western foes rest their heads at night, a resurgent power gains momentum in its quest for vengeance against these same foes of ours. Perhaps we should offer the hand of friendship to them."
 JAP_deport_french_desc:0 "For years, Western citizens have travelled to our country to live in our cities and use our resources, while contributing nothing of value to our glorious nation. None are such horrid offenders as the French, with their disgusting language and cuisine. It is time we end this scourge upon our populace."
 JAP_demand_borneo_desc:0 "For Japan to extend itself outward, its empire cannot simply stop at Itaru. The Dutch are weak, and will surely cave in with the right push. We must show them who is the dominant power of the East."
 JAP_strike_singapore_desc:0 "The British are vulnerable, and we are in position. Now is the time to cripple their fleet in the region and seize their foremost port in the Orient."
 JAP_seize_indies_desc:0 "The Dutch have given into our demands already- this can only mean they are too weak to fight. Forcing a conflict upon them will cause them to cave fully."
 JAP_seize_viet_desc:0 "The French, from a strategic standpoint, are utterly incapable of defending their interests in Indochina. There is simply no reason to not seize their holdings in Indochina."
 JAP_seishin_ron_desc:0 "Since the descent of the Heavenly Emperor Jimmu from the realm of the Gods, China has faced us across the waters, their vast resources left untapped by the pithy excuse of a civilization that resides there. The time to seize these resources and land for ourselves has come."
 JAP_embargo_china_desc:0 "As China descends into instability and conflict, we have the prime opportunity to strain their hand further. Cutting off trade to the Chinese may well be the spark that lights the Chinese tinderbox."
 JAP_incite_warlords_desc:0 "All across China, new military factions are rising, emphasizing independence from the idea of a Unified China. Divided, they surely shall fall!"
 JAP_manchuria_desc:0 "With the Chinese distracted, and the Manchurians having begged us for protection, we have the prime opportunity to begin integrating Manchuria into the Empire itself."
 JAP_hebei_desc:0 "The Chinese continue to crumble, and so we continue to build ourselves up. The time has come to lay claim to Beijing, one of their greatest cities. The Chinese would be foolish to defy our demand, but our forces shall be ready, if they do."
 JAP_war_china_desc:0 "China is in ruins, and their leadership has proven themselves to be pushovers, unable to protect their nation from threats both within and without. The weak will always give way to the strong. Now is the time to eradicate our mortal foe, once and for all."
 JAP_integration_desc:0 "Korea and the Philippines have remained under our control for some time, but the process of converting them to Japanese peoples is taking longer than desired. It is time to hasten the process."
 JAP_hokushin_ron_desc:0 "We easily managed to seize the Russian Trans-Amur region during their instability when our Empire was significantly weaker. Today, Russia stands as weak as before, but it will not remains so for long. We must crush them before they attempt to reclaim what has always been rightfully ours."
 JAP_fortify_amur_desc:0 "The first priority of our dealings with Russia is to install fortifications along our border with them, before they try to cross the river and take our land."
 JAP_blockade_rus_desc:0 "The Russians are proving unruly and unstable in the Pacific. We cannot trust them to not attack our holdings. A blockade will shackle them and put them in their place."
 JAP_befriend_mon_desc:0 "With the warplans against Russia in place, it will be wise to seek partnership with the Mongolians, who desire to reclaim their empire lost to the ages. Their participation in a future conflict with Russia will open a second front for Russia to fight."
 JAP_subdue_mon_desc:0 "With Manchuria in our hands, it is important that we extend the future frontline of the conflict with Russia to the maximum extent. Thus, we must seize the Mongolian lands for ourselves."
 JAP_annex_east_desc:0 "Our forces stand at the ready to crush the Russian savages to the north. Their land and resources will fare much better under our administration. The time to fight is now."
 JAP_mongolia_ind_desc:0 "The Qing made no attempts to modernize Mongolia, and the Mongolians themselves are only barely managing to do so themselves. It appears that they require our assistance in this noble endeavor of theirs."
 JAP_peace_focus_desc:0 "With the warmongers being purged from our country, the time has come to make amends with the powers of the world, and rechart the course of our nation."
 JAP_korea_dmz_desc:0 "The Chinese are still very untrusting of us, and understandably so. Negotiating a demilitarized zone on our border with them will help ease their minds and allow for more open dialogue with them."
 JAP_korea_reps_desc:0 "The British, the humanists they are, are appalled with our past treatment of the Koreans in our nation- but they are not innocent themselves. In any case, paying reparations to Korea as a whole will serve to strengthen Japan's standing in the minds of westerners."
 JAP_amur_dmz_desc:0 "The Russians are wary of us, even after opening the embassy. One of our top foreign policy experts has suggested proposing a DMZ with them to show that we are genuine."
 JAP_urajio_accords_desc:0 "The Russians have expressed their desire to reclaim their territory in the east. This is not necessarily unthinkable; we should hold negotiations with them on the matter."
 JAP_north_mig_desc:0 "With the Russians appeased, we can now begin negotiating stronger, more beneficial mutual ties. The current foremost idea is an immigration treaty that will allow Japan's citizenry to enter Russia for work."
 JAP_reneg_london_desc:0 "The London Treaty has unfairly benefited the British, but it is not solidified or permanent- it can be renegotiated. Entering into dialogue with the British over this will show that we do, indeed, have good intentions at heart."
 JAP_flip_ref_desc:0 "Foreign powers are wary of our holdings abroad, and still have some reservations of our intentions. Many prominent Filipinos in their diaspora communities call upon Japan to grant the Philippines the opportunity for a referendum on their future."
 JAP_path_china_desc:0 "Though Japan can make make friends with both China and Britain, it will ultimately prioritize one over the other. China, a massive nation on our border with whom we share thousands of years of history, deserves this special attention."
 JAP_path_britain_desc:0 "Though Japan can make make friends with both China and Britain, it will ultimately prioritize one over the other. Britain, who still maintains a global empire of immense wealth despite recent troubles, logically deserves our special attention."
 JAP_brit_rubber_desc:0 "British investors have offered to guarantee the regular export of rubber to Japan, as well as to assist Japan in increasing the production of its own. This is an offer we cannot resist."
 JAP_cut_austria_desc:0 "Britain and her allies stand side-by-side against the aggressive Austrian Reich in Europe. A show of solidarity for their cause will surely be well received."
 JAP_anglo_ally_desc:0 "The Anglo-Japanese alliance was cancelled in the 1920s amid worsening relations between Japan and Britain. Having restored our former friendship, it would be prudent to consider the revival of this defensive pact of the two great seafaring empires."
 JAP_crush_ccp_desc:0 "China is still ravaged by war within. We have shown our desire for mutual assistance, but they cannot assist us if we do not first help them now."
 JAP_china_ally_desc:0 "Japan and China together stand as the bastions of freedom and democracy in Asia. Together, we can defend the peoples of Asia as a whole from the wrath of tyranny."
 JAP_invite_russia_desc:0 "Russia and Japan have fully recovered from the dip in relations that started at the turn of the century, and they too stand as a haven of democracy and liberty. The three nations- Japan, China, and Russia- will together form an insurmountable force, such that no malicious foreign power may ever threaten it."
 JAP_mainland_ports_desc:0 "In order to supply a war on the mainland, we must ensure that its ports are able to receive and handle the massive amounts of military equipment that will be shipped overseas."
 JAP_garrisons_desc:0 "As the miniscule islands of the Pacific are predicted to become increasingly important to the future war effort, the need to defend them also increases. Training specialized garrison units will ensure that they are well defended in the days to come."
 JAP_airfields_desc:0 "With war steadily approaching with West, the need to project air power in the Pacific grows. Creating new airbases on our island possessions, and upgrading existing ones, will ensure our ability to win the air war over the sea."
 JAP_fortify_phil_desc:0 "The Philippines are undoubtedly our most vulnerable major overseas holding, and the West will undoubtedly move to seize if if given the momentum in war. Fortifications on its many islands will pre-empt Western attempts at establishing foothold."
 JAP_our_fate_desc:0 "The world is changing. Forces work behind the scenes, preparing to make their moves upon the world. Our future is uncertain. Let us see what is in store for our nation..."
 JAP_cold_weather_desc:0 "As we make preparations for the war in the North, we must ensure our troops are properly acclimated to fighting in such conditions. Hosting extensive exercises on Attu will ensure that our troops will fight effectively in the Siberian Wilderness."
 JAP_amur_log_desc:0 "Any war against Russia will require significant upgrade of the infrastructure on the battlefield. While we cannot yet improve the infrastructure in Russia yet, we can begin work on what we already own, so that our troops begin any offensive with an effective start."
 JAP_puppet_china_desc:0 "Rather than crushing the Chinese, we saved them from destroying themselves. They owe us every fiber of their being- so we will ensure they will pay their due."
 JAP_warplan_g_focus_desc:0 "Even when we stand at the south of the Indonesian archipelago, invading Australia will not be an easy feat. We must ensure our combined military forces are prepared for such an undertaking."
 JAP_crush_warlords_desc:0 "With the principal Chinese government under our boot, the time has come to wipe out the strongholds of the warlords. China belongs to us- all of it."

 #decision descriptions
 KARA_BOGA_desc:0 "to test other decisions"
 JAP_tokyo_ind_desc:0 "As we seek to expand and modernize our airforce, the Nakajima Corporation seeks funding for two new aircraft plants in Tokyo. They intend to construct tactical and strategic bomber aircraft."
 JAP_nagoya_ind_desc:0 "As we seek to expand and modernize our airforce, the Aichi Corporation seeks funding for two new aircraft plants in Nagoya. They intend to construct twin-engined fighters and naval bombers."
 JAP_nagasaki_ind_desc:0 "As we seek to expand and modernize our airforce, the Mitsubishi Corporation seeks funding for two new aircraft plants in Tokyo. They intend to construct single-engined fighters and fighter-bombers."
 JAP_karafuto_ind_desc:0 "Karafuto is just as integral to the Japanese islands as is Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Honshu itself. Under the Russian Empire, our brethren in the north were held back. We must bring them up to par with the rest of the Empire once more."
 JAP_island_ind_desc:0 "Our island holdings can serve as manufacturing centers, bring both employment to the local islanders and helping ensure some industry avoids the eyes of the enemy."
 JAP_mainland_ind_desc:0 "The roads in the Mainland are in poor condition- a single railroad is what connects Hafu to Urajio. We must build up the infrastructure of our mainland holdings if we are to solidify our hold there."
 JAP_adv_torp_desc:0 "A new type of torpedo has been conceptualized, allowing for the same explosive package to be delivered in a smaller warhead. This will, in turn, allow the torpedo as a whole to be cast to far greater ranges than our enemy will expect."
 JAP_adv_sonar_desc:0 "Improved electronic systems have allowed for more powerful forms of sonar detection to be created. This will prevent attacks on our fleet from below the surface."
 JAP_fire_cs_desc:0 "A naval gun is no good if it is unable to hit the target- thus, the higher the accuracy of the gun, the more effective it will be in battle. New Fire Control Systems will aid in stabilizing naval guns to improve accuracy."
 JAP_higheff_engine_desc:0 "Newer forms of naval engines are being devised, which, if developed fully, will afford our ships greater range, allowing our navy to reach farther than ever before."
 JAP_london_visit_desc:0 "His Majesty has never before left the Japanese Realm during His reign, and has expressed his desire to voyage to nations abroad. A stop in London will be the perfect opportunity to negotiate ever closer ties with the British."
 JAP_vienna_visit_desc:0 "His Majesty has never before left the Japanese Realm during His reign, and has expressed his desire to voyage to nations abroad. A stop in Vienna will be the perfect opportunity to negotiate a closer alliance with the Austrians."
 JAP_withdraw_london_desc:0 "The London Treaty was, from the outset, a British ploy to shackle our navy so that they could reign unopposed in the Pacific. To limit our navy on the word of a foreign emissary never was a good idea. It is time we end our adherence to this foolish document." 
 JAP_gunnery_desc:0 "With our navy's focus settled on Battleships, it is important that we further drill our sailors to refine their gunnery skills for combat at sea."
 JAP_sortie_desc:0 "With our navy's focus settled on Aircraft Carriers, it is necessary to ensure that they are able to prepare and deploy sorties as quickly and efficiently as possible."
 JAP_wolfpack_desc:0 "With our navy's focus settled on Submarines, it will be prudent to drill our captains in the practice of wolf-packs- the tactic of hunting for enemy ships in groups, as pioneered by the Austrians in the Mediterranean."
 JAP_fortify_ryojun_desc:0 "As we prepare for a possible conflict, we realize that our most vulnerable holding is the Port of Ryojun. Investment in fortifications of the peninsula will prevent its capture or destruction by the enemy."
 JAP_warplan_g_desc:0 "Our invasion plan for the Australian continent has been completed and is ready for execution."
 JAP_hawaii_navy_desc:0 "Hawaii, a nation with whom we share royal ties, has a devastating lack of industry and is barely able to produce its own warships. We may be able to spare some of our own for them."
 JAP_ketsu_go_start_desc:0 "The enemy is upon us. Not one soul may abstain from the defense of the Emperor and the Empire. Tennōheika Banzai!"
 JAP_ketsu_go_stop_desc:0 "The enemy has been repelled. We must return to normal operations, otherwise we will be unable to continue this war."
 JAP_singapore_attack_desc:0 "The vast majority of the British Oriental Navy can be found docked at Singapore. A single, well-planned strike could cripple them long enough for us to sweep across the entirety of their Asian holdings."
 JAP_shuffle_officers_desc:0 "Reorganizing the Officer Corps from the top-down will help us to quell conspiracy among the officer corps against the legitimate government."
 JAP_interrogate_yamamoto_desc:0 "The Admirals have spoken, and they all say that Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto has information that could be of use to us."
 JAP_bribe_admiralty_desc:0 "If there are anti-government sentiments circulating in the military, we may have to resort to illicit means of our own. Buying off the admiralty may be necessary to ensure the security of our nation."
 JAP_second_amendment_desc:0 "An uprising among the military elite can be defeated by the arming of the populace of Japan. This may be necessary to prevent a possible overthrow of our government."
 JAP_mainland_military_drills_decision_desc:0 "Sending the majority of our home defense forces to the mainland will help thwart the organization of anti-government activities at home."
 JAP_mainland_military_drills_mission_desc:0 "The ongoing military drills in Hafu will hinder rebellious activities, and will help our armed forces improve as a whole."
 JAP_army_purges_desc:0 "Simply purging suspected dissidents out of the army will be the quickest and easiest measure we can take to ensure the security of the current government."
 JAP_arrest_sadao_desc:0 "Admiral Yamamoto has spoken, and has incriminated Sadao as the leader of a conspiracy to launch a coup d'etat against the government. We may now go and arrest him, to put an end to this crisis once and for all."
 JAP_ban_korean_desc:0 "The first step to fully Japanizing Korea will be to make them speak our language. We must mandate that Japanese, and only Japanese, be used in Japanese Korea."
 JAP_ban_tagalog_desc:0 "The first step to fully Japanizing the Philippines will be to make them speak our language. We must mandate that Japanese, and only Japanese, be used in the Japanese Philippines." 
 JAP_migrants_desc:0 "[From.GetName] cannot be Japanized without a significant influx of actual Japanese immigrants. We must open the gates to our new territories."
 JAP_arrest_activists_kor_desc:0 "We cannot allow the work of local Koreans to sabotage our efforts to convert their society to a proper Japanese society. We cannot hope to arrest every Korean, but we can begin with their leaders."
 JAP_arrest_activists_phi_desc:0 "We cannot allow the work of local Filipinos to sabotage our efforts to convert their society to a proper Japanese society. We cannot hope to arrest every Filipino, but we can begin with their leaders."
 JAP_military_parades_kor_desc:0 "A display of strength and power in our colonies will be instrumental in ensuring the coperation of the Korean people with Japan."
 JAP_military_parades_phi_desc:0 "A display of strength and power in our colonies will be instrumental in ensuring the coperation of the Philippine people with Japan."
 JAP_integrate_korea_desc:0 "The time to integrate Korea has come. We may now properly unite them with the rest of the Japanese Realm as a proper prefecture."
 JAP_integrate_phil_desc:0 "The time to integrate the Philippines has come. We may now properly unite them with the rest of the Japanese Realm as a proper prefecture."
 JAP_ally_siam_desc:0 "Apart from us, Siam is the only other nation in Asia to have successfully resisted Western aggression. They could make a useful and loyal ally."
 JAP_war_siam_desc:0 "Siam is unwilling to cooperate with us. We shall thus force them to bend the knee, as with all of our other foes."
 JAP_arm_warlords_desc:0 "Arming the various warring factions in China will serve to destabilize the country further- just what we want."
 JAP_entreat_warlords_desc:0 "Offering the warlords our moral and diplomatic support could serve to make them useful allies in the coming war."
 JAP_warlord_volunteers_desc:0 "Sending our trained soldiers to covertly operate within the various warring factions' armies will make the warlord states a far greater thorn in the Chinese' side."
 JAP_far_east_blockade_decision_desc:0 "The Far-East Blockade is the perfect opportunity to display a show of force over Russia and sever a portion of its economy and wealth."
 JAP_far_east_blockade_mission_desc:0 "The Far-East Blockade is the perfect opportunity to display a show of force over Russia and sever a portion of its economy and wealth."
 JAP_humanitarian_aid_desc:0 "Humanitarian aid to the warring states will improve their opinion of us."
 JAP_hashimoto_speech_desc:0 "General Kingoro Hashimoto wishes to give a rousing speech to the Emperor's subjects."
 JAP_shinto_shrines_desc:0 "A new shrine in one of our most important cultural centers will induce a spiritual rally amongst our populace."
 JAP_share_riches_desc:0 "Sharing the wealth of the Emperor with the poor will help many alleviate their impoverished situations, and will improve the image of the Emperor even more."
 #category descriptions
 JAP_military_crisis_desc:0 "Word is passing around of a movement among the military, including members of both the commissioned and the enlisted, to overthrow the democratically elected government of Japan. We must take measures to ensure their plan does not come to fruition."
 JAP_chinese_intervention_desc:0 "As China continues to deteriorate, a number of prime opportunities to expand our empire and display our strength on the world scale will fall into our laps."
 JAP_foreign_policy_desc:0 "As Japan extends its influence further abroad, it will inevitably come into conflict with the other powers of the world. We must show them that the world belongs to the Emperor."
 JAP_colonial_integration_desc:0 "Our majority non-Japanese territories, Korea and the Philippines, remain a nuisance to the Emperor and to the rest of the Japanese elite. We must work to integrate them, however forcefully it may have to be."
 JAP_military_advancement_desc:0 "To stay ahead of the curve among the world powers, we must continue to innovate and develop new technologies and weapons systems to give us an edge over our future foes on the battlefield."
 JAP_domestic_policy_desc:0 "Maintaining our Empire requires work in the interior, among the people, as well as abroad. A number of measures can be enacted to improve the stability and standing of our government."
