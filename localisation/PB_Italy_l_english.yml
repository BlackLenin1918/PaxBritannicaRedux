PB_ITA_toll_of_war:0 "Toll of the Great War"
PB_ITA_toll_of_war_desc:0 "Italy’s intervention in the Great War was for many a difficult choice to make, as the court of the Bourbon family and many intellectuals favored the dominant Bourbon-alliance of France, Spain and Austria, while the Italian elite were more Entente friendly, favoring an alliance with Britain instead of France. Eventually, Italy joined the Bourbon-alliance against the Entente, but this unpopular decision split Italy into 2 political blocs. With the British invasion of Sicily and the horrific trench warfare at Palermo, the Italian elite openly supported British interests. Backed by popular support and public outrage at the Bourbon dynasty of Two Sicilies, king Alfonso I was forced to end Franco-Italian ties and, with the Rome declaration, joined the Entente in their war against the French alliance. Still, Italy lost many lives due to the horrors of mechanical warfare and the idealism of warfare has been thrown out of the window since the end of the Great War."
PB_ITA_treaty_of_anzio:0 "Treaty of Anzio"
PB_ITA_treaty_of_anzio_desc:0 "While Italy did support the Entente at the end of the war, it was always clear that this loyalty was forced upon Italy through Entente pressure. Thus, Italy had to pay for their crimes against the winning powers of Europe and for joining the Bourbon-alliance against the Entente powers. However, due to Italy’s support in the later years of the war, the great powers actively decided to not unreasonably punish Italy, like they did with France. Instead, Italy was forced to demobilize its army and put future restrictions upon its army, such as restricting the use of chemical warfare and experimental tank warfare. The Italian navy and airforce also were decreased due to the treaty and Italy had to pay a small amount to the winning powers. The treaty, while unpopular in Italy, only inspired fringe revanchist parties and never became a tool for those parties to win popular support, keeping the Italian democratic institution stable and fresh."

  POR_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Kingdom of Portugal§! is a secondary power in Europe in 1933.\n\nThe Empire of Portugal ended with the Brazilian war of Independence, as any relevance Portugal had was lost after losing its primary colony of Brazil. The empire went into an economic decline, quickly becoming one of the poorest countries in Europe. During the Great War, Portugal was scared to get entangled into the web of conflict stretched across Europe. However, British pressure and the threat of Spanish dominance forced Portugal into the Great War, becoming the main front of the §YIberian campaign§! that claimed so many innocent, young lives in the grinding machine of war. \n\nPortuguese troops were able to break the Spanish front in 1908, eventually leading to Spain capitulating on the 7th of may, 1910, sparking §Ythe Spanish Civil War§! with the Portguese troops stuck in the middle of it. Portuguese troops had to quickly redeploy to Galicia and the Portuguese-Spanish border, but not before several more young men were taken in front of our very own eyes. \n\nThe end of the Great War would see Portugal returning to its economic instability and colonial ventures, holding onto our relationship with Britain. However, Manuel II had started to create political enemies, such as §YThe Portuguese Republican Party§! and its paramilitary wing §YThe Liberated Youth§!: While enjoying popular support, the Republican Party itself is divided to its core ideologically, based upon a jacobin-liberal split. Only if Portugal would actively be in an international or national crisis, would the Republican party have a chance of challenging Manuel's reign. Still, Portugal's political landscape has been marked with the blood of politicians and monarchs for decades. What could stop that from happening under Manuel II? \n\nThe §YKingdom of Portugal§! is a §Ysecondary power§!"
