PB_ITA_treaty_of_anzio_1:0 "Treaty of Anzio"
PB_ITA_treaty_of_anzio_1_desc:0 "While Italy did support the Entente at the end of the war, it was always clear that this loyalty was forced upon Italy through Entente pressure. Thus, Italy had to pay for their crimes against the winning powers of Europe and for joining the Bourbon-alliance against the Entente powers. However, due to Italy’s support in the later years of the war, the great powers actively decided to not unreasonably punish Italy, like they did with France. Instead, Italy was forced to demobilize its army and put future restrictions upon its army, such as restricting the use of chemical warfare and experimental tank warfare. The Italian navy and airforce also were decreased due to the treaty and Italy had to pay a small amount to the winning powers."

PB_ITA_Considerable_Political_Violence:0 "The Violent '30s"
PB_ITA_Considerable_Political_Violence_desc:0 "Since the end of the Great War, Italian politics have been nothing short of a military battlefield: political murder and brawls happen weekly and the party paramilitaries don’t improve the situation in the slightest. Few even dare to go outside and buy bread at their local bakery, as the possibility of getting caught between the crossfire of the socialists, syndicalists, anarchists, anarcho-liberals, nationalists and imperialists are quite realistic. The political violence has its roots in the ineffectiveness of the democratic government birthed after the Treaty of Anzio, but the violence continues under the ANI of D’Annunzio, as many are united in their struggle against the regime put in place in 1927."
PB_ITA_Slow_Recovery:0 "Crawling Recovery"
PB_ITA_Slow_Recovery_desc:0 "The economic crisis that hit Italy after the Great War was one of the catalysts for the political instability and violence erupting mere months after peace was achieved. The crisis would bring many young men, fresh from the trenches, into a world of pain and no economic security, as many jobs were scrapped and prices continued to inflate at a ridiculous rate. With no prospect of a good future in sight, many either used alcohol to numb the pain of existence or sought to find meaning the extreme ends of the political spectrum: emboldened by a rotting political establishment and full with rhetoric blaming everything and everyone, these movements gave a future for many young men and even women, promising the world. While this all happened, the economy slowly recovered. Extremism would halt this recovery in the ‘20s, as revolutions and strikes kept the economy from recovering, though leading to a general improvement in the lives of many workers. While it has been quite some time since the crash, the economy remains on the back burner in Italy, with slow recovery being the keyword for both the local and national governments."

# Leader desc and Traits #

ITA_DESC:0 "Born as Prince Ferdinand Pius, §Yduke of Calabria§!, on the 25th of July, 1869, Ferdinand III would be groomed to become the succesor of Alfonso I of Italy. Coming from a grand family (in both prestige and general size), Ferdinand was often in the spotlight, overshadowing his lesser brothers and sisters as the eldest and the potential heir. This relationship would isolate Ferdinand from most of his brothers, except Carlos, which he would later appoint as the minister of the treasury during his reign. As a young lad, he became a member of the Italian army, 18 years after the hight of the risorgimento in 1871, and would quickly rise through the ranks, not experiencing real combat for a long time. With the outbreak of the §YGreat War§! in 1905, Ferdinand was decorated with many awards and commanded the northern Italian troops from his luxurious house on the hills outside of Naples. While not a military genius, he would prove to be somewhat experienced in strategy and held the Italian-German line for years. Eventually, Italy was forced to switch sides with the §YRome Declaration§! in 1907, resigning Ferdinand from his position on the northern front. Ferdinand III would begin his rule in 1911, when Alfonso gave up his throne after having betrayed his allies. Ferdinand's charmastic personality would help Italy stay relatively united after the Great War, but even his personality can not fix everything, as Italy will soon find out."

Parri_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!19/01/1890\n\n§YFerruccio Parri§! is the glue keeping the Italian nation united. Through the alienating post-war periods the democratic government (Officialy proclaimed shortly after the Rome Declaration) managed to maintain rule by shifting the blame to the Imperial Powers, citing them as the main reason Italy couldn't reach her full potential and why the then monarchy was ultimately forced to sign the embarrassing treaty of Anzio.\n\nPrevious Prime Ministers kept a good tradition of convincing the masses and Mr Parri has by far been the best at such a task. Though words can only heal so many wounds and eventually extremist groups gained much in terms of popularity and political influence. The current government, though officially compromised of a mixed Liberal-Conservative majority, has seen an increase in far-right establishments with many minister heads and government leads having Neo-Imperialist sympathies. The far-left has too obtained much popularity with the people though their power politicaly is considered weak.\n\nWith the 1934 elections fast approaching the nation must decide what the future for the nation will look like, and if extremism is the only answer to their problems."

# MISSION TREE #

ITA_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "With the defeat of the Italian Kingdom in the Great War and the humiliating Treaty of Anzio, the Italian establishment became weak in the eyes of many. The turbulence that the democratic governments experienced in the '20s still haunt Italy in the '30s, with nationalists and socialists continueing to destabilize. Under the fresh ANI government of D'Annunzio, Italy has yet to truely recover from the economic malace of after the Great War and heal from the political violence terrorizing the streets of Naples, Rome and Milan. Can the ANI truely recover Italian glory?"
