PB_ITA_treaty_of_anzio:0 "Treaty of Anzio"
PB_ITA_treaty_of_anzio_desc:0 "While Italy did support the Entente at the end of the war, it was always clear that this loyalty was forced upon Italy through Entente pressure. Thus, Italy had to pay for their crimes against the winning powers of Europe and for joining the Bourbon-alliance against the Entente powers. However, due to Italy’s support in the later years of the war, the great powers actively decided to not unreasonably punish Italy, like they did with France. Instead, Italy was forced to demobilize its army and put future restrictions upon its army, such as restricting the use of chemical warfare and experimental tank warfare. The Italian navy and airforce also were decreased due to the treaty and Italy had to pay a small amount to the winning powers."
PB_ITA_Considerable_Political_Violence:0 "The Violent '30s"
PB_ITA_Considerable_Political_Violence_desc:0 "Since the end of the Great War, Italian politics have been nothing short of a military battlefield: political murder and brawls happen weekly and the party paramilitaries don’t improve the situation in the slightest. Few even dare to go outside and buy bread at their local bakery, as the possibility of getting caught between the crossfire of the socialists, syndicalists, anarchists, anarcho-liberals, nationalists and imperialists are quite realistic. The political violence has its roots in the ineffectiveness of the democratic government birthed after the Treaty of Anzio, but the violence continues under the ANI of D’Annunzio, as many are united in their struggle against the regime put in place in 1927."
PB_ITA_Slow_Recovery:0 "Crawling Recovery"
PB_ITA_Slow_Recovery_desc:0 "The economic crisis that hit Italy after the Great War was one of the catalysts for the political instability and violence erupting mere months after peace was achieved. The crisis would bring many young men, fresh from the trenches, into a world of pain and no economic security, as many jobs were scrapped and prices continued to inflate at a ridiculous rate. With no prospect of a good future in sight, many either used alcohol to numb the pain of existence or sought to find meaning the extreme ends of the political spectrum: emboldened by a rotting political establishment and full with rhetoric blaming everything and everyone, these movements gave a future for many young men and even women, promising the world. While this all happened, the economy slowly recovered. Extremism would halt this recovery in the ‘20s, as revolutions and strikes kept the economy from recovering, though leading to a general improvement in the lives of many workers. While it has been quite some time since the crash, the economy remains on the back burner in Italy, with slow recovery being the keyword for both the local and national governments."

  # EVENTS

italy.1.t:0 "Death of the Soldier King"
italy.1.d:0 "The city of Rome, and to a certain extend the entirety of Italy, mourns, as Alfonso the first of Italy has passed away in his sleep today, at the old age of 93. While the king has passed away, a feeling of united mourning has cloacked across Italy. However, Alfonso was far from uniting during his lifetime. During the Great War, after countless months of pressure by both his court and his people, Alfonso made the decision to end Italy's alignment with the Bourbon Pact, abandoning his French and Austrian allies during the Great War and joining the British against them. This action, known as the Rome Declaration, would become a dividing subject for the years to come, as many still debate the actual intent of the Rome declaration. Not long after the end of the war, Alfonso I gave up his crown in favor of his oldest son, Ferdinand, who currently reigns our divine nation. The old king is planned to be buried in Santa Chiara, Naples, alongside all his predecessors, such as Francis II."
italy.1.a:0 "Italy mourns for the old king..."
italy.3.t:0 "Opening of the Liberty Bridge"
italy.3.d:0 "Today, Venice was graced by the presence of Ferdinand I as he was present for the opening of the Ponte della Libertà, Italian for Liberty Bridge. The road bridge connects the centre of the city of Venice to the mainland. Designed by famous Italian engineer Eugenio Miozzi, many Venetians were excited to see this construction of the future opened. Today it was opened by the king and became the only vehicular entrance to the city of Venice. Build out of brick and concrete, the bridge is not necessarily pleasing to look at, but it is clearly an icon for the modern times."
italy.3.a:0 "Interesting"
italy.4.t:0 "British Market Crashed"
italy.4.d:0 "Recent news from London has confirmed one of our biggest fears yet: The British stockmarket, the centre of the global capitalist economy, has collapsed. The reasoning behind the crash is not completely clear yet, but the effects have already affected Italy in several ways. British trade has begun to lower dramatically hours after the crash and many British industries set up in Rome have become prime targets of bankruptcy if they do not defend themselves against the rapidly dropping pound. These effects will definetely not help Italy in the future and many have already prepared for the worst economically."
italy.4.a:0 "Sad days will come..."
italy.5.t:0 "Less Trade in Naples"
italy.5.d:0 "It has become increasingly clear that the British stockmarket has been a stab to the global economy, as many mediterranean nations such as Serbia and Greece have begun to lessen their exports to Italy. The ports of Naples were rather empty today and many employees of the trade industry fear unemployment in the next few weeks. The government has made some promises to the public, but many know that they aren't backed by anything. It will cost us dearly if we are not protected for the economic fallout that comes to Italy."
italy.5.a:0 "It will definetely cost us..."
italy.6.t:0 "Mass Unemployment hits Rome"
italy.6.d:0 "Rome, the city of life, has darkened under the social and economic pressure brought by the stockmarket collapse in London. The many workers that once walked across the streets have steadily declined, while the beggars and homeless people patrolling the roads of Rome have increased. Mass unemployment has become not just a local event for Rome, but has already hit several major northern cities. However, while the southern cities lay in their economic comfort, the hardest winds have yet to blow across Italy."
italy.6.a:0 "Dire times"
italy.7.t:0 "Mese Nero"
italy.7.d:0 "Nearly a month has passed since the collapse of the British economy and the subsequent events that halted the slow recovery of the Italian economy after the early 1920s. The month has been one to remember for many, as many workers were laid off and unemployment skyrocketed across every sector known to Italy. This decimation of our economic efforts and the slow recovery the previous liberal government had counted on has been called 'Mese Nero' or 'Black Month' by the most promintent economists in- and outside of Italy. With this black month hitting us during such a daring time, we'll have to put a lot of effort into our economic reconstruction."
italy.7.a:0 "Comparable to a Greek tragedy..."
italy.8.t:0 "Revoking our Maghreb Guarantee"
italy.8.d:0 "The Maghreb Concessions Zone has been memorized by many as the millionth failed British experiment: carved out of the dying French Empire after the Great War, the international zone was supposed to represent the interests of the victors of the Great War. Later, Italy would join the benefactors and guarantee the sovereignty of the international zone. However, it has become clear that this zone wasn't something that benefitted every nation involved in the region, but only the British Empire. Thus, Italy has decided to revoke its guarantee from the Maghreb Concessions Zone, as there's no point in dying for a small, British puppet in the future."
italy.8.a:0 "What do the British think we are? Idiots?"
italy.9.t:0 "The End of Italy?"
italy.9.d:0 "Due to a serie of unfortunate events, Italy has been split between the nations of old that once reigned prior to the rissorgimento. Their fortune is our misfortune, as the old Italian kingdom is no more. The question now remains: Should we continue to claim the legacy of Italy and reconquer the peninsula piece by piece, or accept our fate and rejoice as the kingdom of Two Sicilies under our isolated royal family?"
italy.9.a:0 "Italy is not yet lost!"
italy.9.b:0 "Our roots, we shall never forget..."


italy.36.t:0 "Governor opens the Palermo Highway"
italy.36.d:0 "The local Sicilian governor Cesare Mori and the mayor of Palermo Di Marzo, both having ties with the local ANI branch, recently opened the Palermo highway, a project funded by the Napoli government as to connect the rural island of Sicily between the east and the west. The infrastructure project is, however, not only financially motivated, but also politically: The region of Sicily has always been disconnected from the Italian peninsula due to the strait of Messina, allowing the mafia and separatists to thrive in the region. The new infrastructure layed down could potentially keep the region more connected to its centers and Italy as a whole."
italy.36.a:0 "Bravo"
italy.37.t:0 "Beginning of the Red Months"
italy.37.d:0 "The boys of Rome selling newspapers scream at the top of their lungs, as the headlines of the papers boldy read: 'Socialists revolutionaries occupy northern towns'. While the Italian media is far from factual, the headlines are not wrong. \n\nThe rising political tension and the violence Italy has experienced for nearly 10 years now has boiled over this week, as the murder of Italian socialist Giacomo Matteotti broke the camel's back. Public opinion against the ANI and the blueshirts quickly turned, which was gracefully used by the Italian Socialist Party in their quest of subverting the nationalist government and toppling it through any means necessary. The death of Matteotti led to regional strikes in the north, with few occupying the factories. These loose fractions of the Socialist Party have been unorganized and without a central leader, but the tide could quickly turn if we don't act fast. \n\nIn light of the violence in Northern Italy, Ferdinand III has adressed the public, trying to calm it down and preaching unity. His speech has, however, become the butt of the joke for many socialists and republicans, not caring about any idea of unity or order apparantely."
italy.37.a:0 "Let's hope it doesn't worsen..."
italy.38.t:0 "Death of Giacomo Matteotti"
italy.38.d:0 "Giacomo Matteotti, prominent socialist and anti-ANI activist, has been found dead 23 kilomters north of Rome. His suspected murderers were found shortly after, all of which were members of the Italian blueshirt organization. After stabbing the activist several times in their Lancia Lambda, the blueshirts dumped his body in a creek, hoping that nobody would miss him. \n\nWhile members of the blueshirts, questions on the involvement of Roberto Farinacci remain unanswered, as all suspects currently remain quiet."
italy.38.a:0 "My God..."
italy.39.t:0 "The 18th Milan Congress"
italy.39.d:0 "With the fall of order in northern Italy, the socialist parties involved were invited to the PSI's 18th annual Milan Congress. The congress was focussed on the unification of the anti-ANI forces in the north of Italy through negotiations and ideological debate. While the eventual conclusion of the congress didn't produce an effective bloc against the government, the stepping stones towards further cooperation have clearly been set."
italy.39.a:0 "Shocking"
italy.40.t:0 "Peasant Strikes on the Padan Plain"
italy.40.d:0 "The revolutionary fervour that has infected the north of the country has spread itself away from the cities and into the countryside: socialists and anarchists have spread their ideas to like-minded farmers on the Padan Plain in the north, leading to peasant strikes. The strikes, however, are independent from the strikes in the cities, loosely tied to the political idea of established socialism. Instead, these peasants strike for better working and living conditions."
italy.40.a:0 "Let them strike!"
italy.40.b:0 "We can promise those things, can't we?"
italy.41.t:0 "The Bologna Revolution"
italy.41.d:0 "After several months of violence, strikes and government action, the Italian Socialist Party has declared an end to state surpression of socialists across Italy. In their declaration, the PSI denounces the ANI government and declares itself the legitimate government of all Italian people. Despite being completely ridiculous, the declaration has gathered a lot of support for the PSI in the most left-wing regions of northern Italy, leading to these states joining the PSI in their open revolution against the Roman government."
italy.41.a:0 "They won't last a month!"

ITA_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Kingdom of Italy§! is a secondary continental power \n\nThe Italian peninsula has known decades of unrest, divided by the former city-states and hegemonic powers of Europe, such as Austria, France and Spain. This playball of the European powers would make it the ideal place for unification under a Bourbon monarchy, which would happen in 1871 after the end of the §YTurin campaign§! of the French empire and the §YKingdom of Two Sicilies§!, uniting Italy under a Southern Bourbon powerhouse. Prior to the Great War of 1905, the Bourbons of Italy continued to support the French and Spanish Bourbons in European geopolitics, but such support did not gain any support from the urban elite and university intellectuals, which all supported British ties. This divide, known in the history books as the §YQuestion of Loyalty§!, would haunt Italy to the very end of the Great War. \n\nItaly, as a member of the Bourbon Pact, would support France and Spain in the Great War, fighting on the mountains of Tirol and in the deserts of Libya. The fighting quickly took a toll on the Italian nation, as social unrest grew to a boiling point. Being cut off from Asian and South American food imports and the British landing in Sicily would eventually be the turning point for Italy, as the pro-British administration forced the king to end the Bourbon alliance in 1907, announced during the 21st of May §YRome Declaration§!. These series of events would have most likely doomed France, as, while Italy's army was not quite as modernized as the French or Spanish army, would open up a new front for the French army. \n\nDuring the peace negotiations at the end of the Great War, Italy would not be held accountable for most of the damage done during the Great War, having to pay only for the British naval losses in the Mediterannean. The Italian navy and airforce were also cut down to size, but the Italians were allowed to keep their colonies and were even give the city of Nice from France. Due to the rather soft approach towards Italy from the allied nations, Italian politics would never devolve to such a point of hyper-nationalism, comparable to the French Republic. \n\n§YThe Kingdom of Italy§! is a §Ysecondary power§!"
ITA_LOSES_CORES:0 "§RThe Kingdom of Two Sicilies will lose all its cores on the Italian peninsula and will only be able to regain them through conquest and embracing Italian nationalism once more."
ITA_DESC:0 "Born as Prince Ferdinand Pius, §Yduke of Calabria§!, on the 25th of July, 1869, Ferdinand III would be groomed to become the succesor of Alfonso I of Italy. Coming from a grand family (in both prestige and general size), Ferdinand was often in the spotlight, overshadowing his lesser brothers and sisters as the eldest and the potential heir. This relationship would isolate Ferdinand from most of his brothers, except Carlos, which he would later appoint as the minister of the treasury during his reign. As a young lad, he became a member of the Italian army, 18 years after the hight of the risorgimento in 1971, and would quickly rise through the ranks, not experiencing real combat for a long time. With the outbreak of the §YGreat War§! in 1905, Ferdinand was decorated with many awards and commanded the northern Italian troops from his luxurious house on the hills outside of Naples. While not a military genius, he would prove to be somewhat experienced in strategy and held the Italian-German line for years. Eventually, Italy was forced to switch sides with the §YRome Declaration§! in 1907, resigning Ferdinand from his position on the northern front. Ferdinand III would begin his rule in 1911, when Alfonso gave up his throne after having betrayed his allies. Ferdinand's charmastic personality would help Italy stay relatively united after the Great War, but even his personality can not fix everything, as Italy will soon find out."

The turbulence that the democratic governments experienced in the '20s still haunt Italy in the '30s, with nationalists and socialists continueing to destabilize. Under the fresh ANI government of D'Annunzio, Italy has yet to truely recover from the economic malace of after the Great War and heal from the political violence terrorizing the streets of Naples, Rome and Milan.

The political violence brought on by these strikes and the chaos brought by the anarchists and syndicalists are all symptoms of revolutionary ambitions! \n\nTo keep order and stability in Italy, the ANI will have to either crackdown upon this socialist movement or negotiate a deal with the syndicalists, jacobins and anarchists."

PB_ITA_Cooperate_with_the_Squadristi_desc:0 "The Squadristi is a term used to describe the nationalist mobs and squads harassing socialists and workers since the beginning of the political violence in the 1920s. Their existance could be beneficial to the ANI, as these nationalists and their clashes with the socialists could help us push back the reds in several keypoints in Italy."
PB_ITA_Organize_Tax_Strikes:0 "Organize Tax Strikes"
PB_ITA_Organize_Tax_Strikes_desc:0 "Despite the fact that strikes are most often used by the left, strikes are far from simply a left-wing concept and could just as easily be utilized by the right! Many inside the party have plans to organize so-called 'tax strikes' in socialist controlled towns and cities, as to disrupt their agenda and spread instability and doubt among their ranks."

PB_ITA_Murder_Local_Opponents_desc:0 "Murder may be a bit excessive in many cases, but the instability brought by the socialists has been amoral at best, leaving us no other choice but to ignore morality and eliminate local opponents."

PB_ITA_Meet_with_the_Unions_desc:0 "As the heart of the strikes, the labor unions are rather important players in the chaos. To have them as allies or convince them to stop their strikes would be a massive relief for the government and can be an important stepping stone towards eventual negotiations."
PB_ITA_Improve_Local_Rights:0 "Release Figureheads"
PB_ITA_Improve_Local_Rights_desc:0 "The current figureheads of many local movements are either imprisoned or on the run for the law. It would be a great sign of respect and trust towards the workers and the parties involved to release these figureheads from prison."
PB_ITA_Chain_Local_Squadristi:0 "Surpress the Squadristi"
PB_ITA_Chain_Local_Squadristi_desc:0 "As local nationalist vigilants, the Squadristi have been a major force fighting against the workers and socialists during the 1920s and '30s. However, they have become a big problem for the government in their pursuit of reaching an agreement with the socialists and should thus be surpressed at all cost."
