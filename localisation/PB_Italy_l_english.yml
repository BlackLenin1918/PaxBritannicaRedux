PB_ITA_treaty_of_anzio:0 "Treaty of Anzio"
PB_ITA_treaty_of_anzio_desc:0 "While Italy did support the Entente at the end of the war, it was always clear that this loyalty was forced upon Italy through Entente pressure. Thus, Italy had to pay for their crimes against the winning powers of Europe and for joining the Bourbon-alliance against the Entente powers. However, due to Italy’s support in the later years of the war, the great powers actively decided to not unreasonably punish Italy, like they did with France. Instead, Italy was forced to demobilize its army and put future restrictions upon its army, such as restricting the use of chemical warfare and experimental tank warfare. The Italian navy and airforce also were decreased due to the treaty and Italy had to pay a small amount to the winning powers."
PB_ITA_Considerable_Political_Violence:0 "Considerable Political Violence"
PB_ITA_Considerable_Political_Violence_desc:0 "Since the end of the Great War, Italian politics have been nothing short of a military battlefield: political murder and brawls happen weekly and the party paramilitaries don’t improve the situation in the slightest. Few even dare to go outside and buy bread at their local bakery, as the possibility of getting caught between the crossfire of the socialists, syndicalists, anarchists, anarcho-liberals, nationalists and imperialists are quite realistic. The political violence has its roots in the ineffectiveness of the democratic government birthed after the Treaty of Anzio, but the violence continues under the ANI of D’Annunzio, as many are united in their struggle against the regime put in place in 1927."
PB_ITA_Slow_Recovery:0 "Crawling Recovery"
PB_ITA_Slow_Recovery_desc:0 "The economic crisis that hit Italy after the Great War was one of the catalysts for the political instability and violence erupting mere months after peace was achieved. The crisis would bring many young men, fresh from the trenches, into a world of pain and no economic security, as many jobs were scrapped and prices continued to inflate at a ridiculous rate. With no prospect of a good future in sight, many either used alcohol to numb the pain of existence or sought to find meaning the extreme ends of the political spectrum: emboldened by a rotting political establishment and full with rhetoric blaming everything and everyone, these movements gave a future for many young men and even women, promising the world. While this all happened, the economy slowly recovered. Extremism would halt this recovery in the ‘20s, as revolutions and strikes kept the economy from recovering, though leading to a general improvement in the lives of many workers. While it has been quite some time since the crash, the economy remains on the back burner in Italy, with slow recovery being the keyword for both the local and national governments."

italy.1.t:0 "Death of the Soldier King"
italy.1.d:0 "The city of Rome, and to a certain extend the entirety of Italy, mourns, as Alfonso the first of Italy has passed away in his sleep today, at the old age of 93. While the king has passed away, a feeling of united mourning has cloacked across Italy. However, Alfonso was far from uniting during his lifetime. During the Great War, after countless months of pressure by both his court and his people, Alfonso made the decision to end Italy's alignment with the Bourbon Pact, abandoning his French and Austrian allies during the Great War and joining the British against them. This action, known as the Rome Declaration, would become a dividing subject for the years to come, as many still debate the actual intent of the Rome declaration. Not long after the end of the war, Alfonso I gave up his crown in favor of his oldest son, Ferdinand, who currently reigns our divine nation. The old king is planned to be buried in Santa Chiara, Naples, alongside all his predecessors, such as Francis II."
italy.1.a:0 "Italy mourns for the old king..."
italy.3.t:0 "Opening of the Liberty Bridge"
italy.3.d:0 "Today, Venice was graced by the presence of Ferdinand I as he was present for the opening of the Ponte della Libertà, Italian for Liberty Bridge. The road bridge connects the centre of the city of Venice to the mainland. Designed by famous Italian engineer Eugenio Miozzi, many Venetians were excited to see this construction of the future opened. Today it was opened by the king and became the only vehicular entrance to the city of Venice. Build out of brick and concrete, the bridge is not necessarily pleasing to look at, but it is clearly an icon for the modern times."
italy.3.a:0 "Interesting"
italy.4.t:0 "British Market Crashed"
italy.4.d:0 "Recent news from London has confirmed one of our biggest fears yet: The British stockmarket, the centre of the global capitalist economy, has collapsed. The reasoning behind the crash is not completely clear yet, but the effects have already affected Italy in several ways. British trade has begun to lower dramatically hours after the crash and many British industries set up in Rome have become prime targets of bankruptcy if they do not defend themselves against the rapidly dropping pound. These effects will definetely not help Italy in the future and many have already prepared for the worst economically."
italy.4.a:0 "Sad days will come..."
italy.5.t:0 "Less Trade in Naples"
italy.5.d:0 "It has become increasingly clear that the British stockmarket has been a stab to the global economy, as many mediterranean nations such as Serbia and Greece have begun to lessen their exports to Italy. The ports of Naples were rather empty today and many employees of the trade industry fear unemployment in the next few weeks. The government has made some promises to the public, but many know that they aren't backed by anything. It will cost us dearly if we are not protected for the economic fallout that comes to Italy."
italy.5.a:0 "It will definetely cost us..."
italy.6.t:0 "Mass Unemployment hits Rome"
italy.6.d:0 "Rome, the city of life, has darkened under the social and economic pressure brought by the stockmarket collapse in London. The many workers that once walked across the streets have steadily declined, while the beggars and homeless people patrolling the roads of Rome have increased. Mass unemployment has become not just a local event for Rome, but has already hit several major northern cities. However, while the southern cities lay in their economic comfort, the hardest winds have yet to blow across Italy."
italy.6.a:0 "Dire times"
italy.9.t:0 "The End of Italy?"
italy.9.d:0 "Due to a serie of unfortunate events, Italy has been split between the nations of old that once reigned prior to the rissorgimento. Their fortune is our misfortune, as the old Italian kingdom is no more. The question now remains: Should we continue to claim the legacy of Italy and reconquer the peninsula piece by piece, or accept our fate and rejoice as the kingdom of Two Sicilies under our isolated royal family?"
italy.9.a:0 "Italy is not yet lost!"
italy.9.b:0 "Our roots, we shall never forget..."

italy.36.t:0 "Governor opens the Palermo Highway"
italy.36.d:0 "The local Sicilian governor Cesare Mori and the mayor of Palermo Di Marzo, both having ties with the local ANI branch, recently opened the Palermo highway, a project funded by the Napoli government as to connect the rural island of Sicily between the east and the west. The infrastructure project is, however, not only financially motivated, but also politically: The region of Sicily has always been disconnected from the Italian peninsula due to the strait of Messina, allowing the mafia and separatists to thrive in the region. The new infrastructure layed down could potentially keep the region more connected to its centers and Italy as a whole."
italy.36.a:0 "Bravo"

ITA_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Kingdom of Italy§! is a secondary continental power \n\nThe Italian peninsula has known decades of unrest, divided by the former city-states and hegemonic powers of Europe, such as Austria, France and Spain. This playball of the European powers would make it the ideal place for unification under a Bourbon monarchy, which would happen in 1871 after the end of the §YTurin campaign§! of the French empire and the §YKingdom of Two Sicilies§!, uniting Italy under a Southern Bourbon powerhouse. Prior to the Great War of 1905, the Bourbons of Italy continued to support the French and Spanish Bourbons in European geopolitics, but such support did not gain any support from the urban elite and university intellectuals, which all supported British ties. This divide, known in the history books as the §YQuestion of Loyalty§!, would haunt Italy to the very end of the Great War. \n\nItaly, as a member of the Bourbon Pact, would support France and Spain in the Great War, fighting on the mountains of Tirol and in the deserts of Libya. The fighting quickly took a toll on the Italian nation, as social unrest grew to a boiling point. Being cut off from Asian and South American food imports and the British landing in Sicily would eventually be the turning point for Italy, as the pro-British administration forced the king to end the Bourbon alliance in 1907, announced during the 21st of May §YRome Declaration§!. These series of events would have most likely doomed France, as, while Italy's army was not quite as modernized as the French or Spanish army, would open up a new front for the French army. \n\nDuring the peace negotiations at the end of the Great War, Italy would not be held accountable for most of the damage done during the Great War, having to pay only for the British naval losses in the Mediterannean. The Italian navy and airforce were also cut down to size, but the Italians were allowed to keep their colonies and were even give the city of Nice from France. Due to the rather soft approach towards Italy from the allied nations, Italian politics would never devolve to such a point of hyper-nationalism, comparable to the French Republic. \n\n§YThe Kingdom of Italy§! is a §Ysecondary power§!"
ITA_LOSES_CORES:0 "§RThe Kingdom of Two Sicilies will lose all its cores on the Italian peninsula and will only be able to regain them through conquest and embracing Italian nationalism once more."
ITA_DESC:0 "Born as Prince Ferdinand Pius, §Yduke of Calabria§!, on the 25th of July, 1869, Ferdinand III would be groomed to become the succesor of Alfonso I of Italy. Coming from a grand family (in both prestige and general size), Ferdinand was often in the spotlight, overshadowing his lesser brothers and sisters as the eldest and the potential heir. This relationship would isolate Ferdinand from most of his brothers, except Carlos, which he would later appoint as the minister of the treasury during his reign. As a young lad, he became a member of the Italian army, 18 years after the hight of the risorgimento in 1971, and would quickly rise through the ranks, not experiencing real combat for a long time. With the outbreak of the §YGreat War§! in 1905, Ferdinand was decorated with many awards and commanded the northern Italian troops from his luxurious house on the hills outside of Naples. While not a military genius, he would prove to be somewhat experienced in strategy and held the Italian-German line for years. Eventually, Italy was forced to switch sides with the §YRome Declaration§! in 1907, resigning Ferdinand from his position on the northern front. Ferdinand III would begin his rule in 1911, when Alfonso gave up his throne after having betrayed his allies. Ferdinand's charmastic personality would help Italy stay relatively united after the Great War, but even his personality can not fix everything, as Italy will soon find out."

#########MISSION TREE
ITA_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Italy has been relatively stable ever since the Great War compared to the other European powers. While extreme nationalism still exists in the nation, it does not thrive and many people support the healthy democracy that the nation sports. On the worldstage, Italy has grown in importance due to its colonial ambitions and its difficult Anglo-French relationship, leading few politicians to safely bet on Italy in any upcoming conflict, though many do agree that the democracy of Italy will most likely support the liberal world order. However, can Italy survive economic hardship and keep its democracy clear and clean?"
