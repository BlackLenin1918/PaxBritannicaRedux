PB_ITA_toll_of_war:0 "Toll of the Great War"
PB_ITA_toll_of_war_desc:0 "Italy’s intervention in the Great War was for many a difficult choice to make, as the court of the Bourbon family and many intellectuals favored the dominant Bourbon-alliance of France, Spain and Austria, while the Italian elite were more Entente friendly, favoring an alliance with Britain instead of France. Eventually, Italy joined the Bourbon-alliance against the Entente, but this unpopular decision split Italy into 2 political blocs. With the British invasion of Sicily and the horrific trench warfare at Palermo, the Italian elite openly supported British interests. Backed by popular support and public outrage at the Bourbon dynasty of Two Sicilies, king Alfonso I was forced to end Franco-Italian ties and, with the Rome declaration, joined the Entente in their war against the French alliance. Still, Italy lost many lives due to the horrors of mechanical warfare and the idealism of warfare has been thrown out of the window since the end of the Great War."
PB_ITA_treaty_of_anzio:0 "Treaty of Anzio"
PB_ITA_treaty_of_anzio_desc:0 "While Italy did support the Entente at the end of the war, it was always clear that this loyalty was forced upon Italy through Entente pressure. Thus, Italy had to pay for their crimes against the winning powers of Europe and for joining the Bourbon-alliance against the Entente powers. However, due to Italy’s support in the later years of the war, the great powers actively decided to not unreasonably punish Italy, like they did with France. Instead, Italy was forced to demobilize its army and put future restrictions upon its army, such as restricting the use of chemical warfare and experimental tank warfare. The Italian navy and airforce also were decreased due to the treaty and Italy had to pay a small amount to the winning powers. The treaty, while unpopular in Italy, only inspired fringe revanchist parties and never became a tool for those parties to win popular support, keeping the Italian democratic institution stable and fresh."
PB_ITA_grinding_import:0 "No More Trade"
PB_ITA_grinding_import_desc:0 "As the global economy collapses, Italy's trade business has lost an enormous amount of money from the grinding imports and exports. Many nations return to their protectionist roots and do not allow most of their last merchants to export homegrown goods to rivals or friends, hoping to save the economy with every last bit. Italy has suffered the brunt of this grinding trade halt, leaving the ports of the proud Italian state empty like the Sahara desert."

italy.1.t:0 "Death of the Soldier King"
italy.1.d:0 "The city of Rome, and to a certain extend the entirety of Italy, mourns, as Alfonso the first of Italy has passed away in his sleep today, at the old age of 93. While the king has passed away, a feeling of united mourning has cloacked across Italy. However, Alfonso was far from uniting during his lifetime. During the Great War, after countless months of pressure by both his court and his people, Alfonso made the decision to end Italy's alignment with the Bourbon Pact, abandoning his French and Austrian allies during the Great War and joining the British against them. This action, known as the Rome Declaration, would become a dividing subject for the years to come, as our parliament still debates on the actual intent of the Rome declaration. Not long after the end of the war, Alfonso I gave up his crown in favor of his oldest son, Ferdinand, who currently reigns our divine nation. The old king is planned to be buried in Santa Chiara, Naples, alongside all his predecessors, such as Francis II."
italy.1.a:0 "Italy mourns for the old king..."
italy.2.t:0 "Giorno Di Salvezza"
italy.2.d:0 "Giorno Di Salvezza (ENG: Day of Salvation) is a national holiday in Italy, celebrated in mostly the Southern parts of the nation. The day not only celebrates those who had given their lives for Italian democracy and christianity in the Great War, but also celebrates the Rome Declaration, the speech given by Alfonso I on the 26th of May, 1907, that would end the Italian loyalty to the French Bourbons and the Austrian habsburgs during the Great War. After the Rome Declaration, Italy sought to join the Entente of Britain, Germany and Russia in their war against the French. This day is seen by many as a turning point, as most of the working population favored the British compared to the French in the war and, with the Rome Declaration, the voice of the people was clearly heared by the monarchy. While liberals celebrate this day for this simple fact, monarchists celebrate the day as a tribute to the Bourbons of Italy, as their realpolitik left Italy in a victorious position with minimal damage. Though not all Italian celebrate Giorno Di Salvezza, the streets of Rome are still filled with happy faces."
italy.2.a:0 "Evviva!"
italy.3.t:0 "Opening of the Liberty Bridge"
italy.3.d:0 "Today, Venice was graced by the presence of Ferdinand I as he was present for the opening of the Ponte della Libertà, Italian for Liberty Bridge. The road bridge connects the centre of the city of Venice to the mainland. Designed by famous Italian engineer Eugenio Miozzi, many Venetians were excited to see this construction of the future opened. Today it was opened by the king and became the only vehicular entrance to the city of Venice. Build out of brick and concrete, the bridge is not necessarily pleasing to look at, but it is clearly an icon for the modern times."
italy.3.a:0 "Interesting"
italy.4.t:0 "British Market Crashed"
italy.4.d:0 "Recent news from London has confirmed one of our biggest fears yet: The British stockmarket, the centre of the global capitalist economy, has collapsed. The reasoning behind the crash is not completely clear yet, but the effects have already affected Italy in several ways. British trade has begun to lower dramatically hours after the crash and many British industries set up in Rome have become prime targets of bankruptcy if they do not defend themselves against the rapidly dropping pound. These effects will definetely not help Italy in the future and many have already prepared for the worst economically."
italy.4.a:0 "Sad days will come..."
italy.5.t:0 "Less Trade in Naples"
italy.5.d:0 "It has become increasingly clear that the British stockmarket has been a stab to the global economy, as many mediterranean nations such as Serbia and Greece have begun to lessen their exports to Italy. The ports of Naples were rather empty today and many employees of the trade industry fear unemployment in the next few weeks. The government has made some promises to the public, but many know that they aren't backed by anything. It will cost us dearly if we are not protected for the economic fallout that comes to Italy."
italy.5.a:0 "It will definetely cost us..."
italy.6.t:0 "Mass Unemployment hits Rome"
italy.6.d:0 "Rome, the city of life, has darkened under the social and economic pressure brought by the stockmarket collapse in London. The many workers that once walked across the streets have steadily declined, while the beggars and homeless people patrolling the roads of Rome have increased. Mass unemployment has become not just a local event for Rome, but has already hit several major northern cities. However, while the southern cities lay in their economic comfort, the hardest winds have yet to blow across Italy."
italy.6.a:0 "Dire times"
italy.7.t:0 "Italian Import Grinds to a Halt"
italy.7.d:0 "Almost a month since the London stockmarket collapsed, Italy has been hit by the hardest blows of the economic failure of global capitalism. The once busy ports of Naples, Venice and Palermo have been reduced to ghost towns, with the occasional merchant ship passing by. The trade between nations have grinded to a slow halt and many have lost their jobs in the naval industry. Many Italian ships now lay on the shores of the peninsula, as merchants and craftsmen have lost any purpose in our society, only living through the mercy of the more fortunate that have the luxury of walking through the streets of Italy without having to beg for money, food, water or medicine."
italy.7.a:0 "Italy has hit a low point"
italy.8.t:0 "Issue of the Loans"
italy.8.d:0 "With the recent worldwide collapse of the economic system, several nations have scrambled to Italy, demanding the repayment of loans given to our economic minister, Carlos of Bourbon, which he used for the expansion of the industry during the years after the Great War. While the extend of his loans is unknown to parliament and even the king himself, the debt we've gained due to him has been staggering, almost hitting 250% of our GDP. Such an amount of debt is unpresidented in the history of the mediterranean nations. The government is currently in a political crisis, divided on the very issue of repaying the debts at all. Several liberal and nationalist parties have proposed defaulting the national debt, hoping for the best. While a high risk move, it could potentially solve the debt issue. The more conservative parties, however, are not fans of the high risk of defaulting the national debt and have proposed the simple solution of just repaying the loans to the demanding nations."
italy.8.a:0 "The debate continues"
italy.9.t:0 "The End of Italy?"
italy.9.d:0 "Due to a serie of unfortunate events, Italy has been split between the nations of old that once reigned prior to the rissorgimento. Their fortune is our misfortune, as the old Italian kingdom is no more. The question now remains: Should we continue to claim the legacy of Italy and reconquer the peninsula piece by piece, or accept our fate and rejoice as the kingdom of Two Sicilies under our isolated royal family?"
italy.9.a:0 "Italy is not yet lost!"
italy.9.b:0 "Our roots, we shall never forget..."

  POR_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Kingdom of Portugal§! is a secondary power in Europe in 1933.\n\nThe Empire of Portugal ended with the Brazilian war of Independence, as any relevance Portugal had was lost after losing its primary colony of Brazil. The empire went into an economic decline, quickly becoming one of the poorest countries in Europe. During the Great War, Portugal was scared to get entangled into the web of conflict stretched across Europe. However, British pressure and the threat of Spanish dominance forced Portugal into the Great War, becoming the main front of the §YIberian campaign§! that claimed so many innocent, young lives in the grinding machine of war. \n\nPortuguese troops were able to break the Spanish front in 1908, eventually leading to Spain capitulating on the 7th of may, 1910, sparking §Ythe Spanish Civil War§! with the Portguese troops stuck in the middle of it. Portuguese troops had to quickly redeploy to Galicia and the Portuguese-Spanish border, but not before several more young men were taken in front of our very own eyes. \n\nThe end of the Great War would see Portugal returning to its economic instability and colonial ventures, holding onto our relationship with Britain. However, Manuel II had started to create political enemies, such as §YThe Portuguese Republican Party§! and its paramilitary wing §YThe Liberated Youth§!: While enjoying popular support, the Republican Party itself is divided to its core ideologically, based upon a jacobin-liberal split. Only if Portugal would actively be in an international or national crisis, would the Republican party have a chance of challenging Manuel's reign. Still, Portugal's political landscape has been marked with the blood of politicians and monarchs for decades. What could stop that from happening under Manuel II? \n\nThe §YKingdom of Portugal§! is a §Ysecondary power§!"
ITA_LOSES_CORES:0 "§RThe Kingdom of Two Sicilies will lose all its cores on the Italian peninsula and will only be able to regain them through conquest and embracing Italian nationalism once more."
