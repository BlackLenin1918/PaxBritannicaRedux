ITA_LOSES_CORES:0 "§RThe Kingdom of Two Sicilies will lose all its cores on the Italian peninsula and will only be able to regain them through conquest and embracing Italian nationalism once more."
ITA_DESC:0 "Born as Prince Ferdinand Pius, §Yduke of Calabria§!, on the 25th of July, 1869, Ferdinand III would be groomed to become the succesor of Alfonso I of Italy. Coming from a grand family (in both prestige and general size), Ferdinand was often in the spotlight, overshadowing his lesser brothers and sisters as the eldest and the potential heir. This relationship would isolate Ferdinand from most of his brothers, except Carlos, which he would later appoint as the minister of the treasury during his reign. As a young lad, he became a member of the Italian army, 18 years after the hight of the risorgimento in 1971, and would quickly rise through the ranks, not experiencing real combat for a long time. With the outbreak of the §YGreat War§! in 1905, Ferdinand was decorated with many awards and commanded the northern Italian troops from his luxurious house on the hills outside of Naples. While not a military genius, he would prove to be somewhat experienced in strategy and held the Italian-German line for years. Eventually, Italy was forced to switch sides with the §YRome Declaration§! in 1907, resigning Ferdinand from his position on the northern front. Ferdinand III would begin his rule in 1911, when Alfonso gave up his throne after having betrayed his allies. Ferdinand's charmastic personality would help Italy stay relatively united after the Great War, but even his personality can not fix everything, as Italy will soon find out."

#########MISSION TREE
ITA_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "With the defeat of the Italian Kingdom in the Great War and the humiliating Treaty of Anzio, the Italian establishment became weak in the eyes of many. The turbulence that the democratic governments experienced in the '20s still haunt Italy in the '30s, with nationalists and socialists continueing to destabilize. Under the fresh ANI government of D'Annunzio, Italy has yet to truely recover from the economic malace of after the Great War and heal from the political violence terrorizing the streets of Naples, Rome and Milan. Can the ANI truely recover Italian glory?"
ITA_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YFeatures:§!\n    - End the most brutal civil war in Italian history \n    - Win the suspended 1931 election \n    - Pick your allies carefully in the upcoming geopolitical crisis \n    - Modernize Italy and pull it out of the War Crawl \n    - Repeat the Rome declaration and shift the balance of war \n\n§YSituation:§!\n§YThe Kingdom of Italy§! is a nation divided by extremism in 1933.\n\nUnited under the soft, velvet glove of the §YKingdom of Two Sicilies§!, the Kingdom of Italy would become a major European power in the 20th century, playing a pivotal role for the Bourbon war effort. However, despite our greatest efforts, Italy would only experience a pyrrhic victory as the kingdom was forced to change sides by the British in 1907 with the §YDeclaration of Rome§!. \n\nDespite technically ending on the side of the victors of the Great War, Italy wouldn't find itself gaining anything in the following treaties. The §YTreaty of Anzio§! would limit the military capabilities of the nation and declare the Bourbons the sole aggressors of the conflict. However, due to Alfonso's voluntary abdication, the Italian monarchy was spared to reign another day, though limited in their previously absolutist power by a new, liberal parliament formed out of the previous governmental bodies of the Kingdom. \n\nThe 20th century would not become any kinder to Italy, as the Rome Declaration would be seen as a honourless act by many Italian nationalists. The new young democracy, despite the wind of change spreading across Italy's major cities, would have to endure many cases of extreme political violence, as the paramilitaries of the §gANI§! and the §Rvarious jacobin groups§! clashed in the streets, spilling blood every other week. The situation wouldn't improve under the many PLI governments, having trouble to recover from the Great War and suffering under the phenomenon of war crawl, as the agrarian economy of Italy was not able to recover as quickly as the industrialized and modern West European and North American economies. The economic situation synthesizes with the polarisation of Italian politics and would turn the country into a gunpowder barrel, awaiting the spark that would trigger reaction from the radicals. That spark would come in 1929 with an §Yattempted coup d'état in Naples§!, as D'Annunzio's supporters tried to storm the parliament and the royal palace, to no avail. As the government moved to detain D'Annunzio and ban the party, the ANI moved north and kickstarted the §YItalian Civil War (1929-)§!. \n\nAs the blood of Italian brothers and sisters spills in the streets of Florence, Venice, Palermo and Naples, parlement decided to suspend the election of 1931 until the end of the civil war. While far from uncontroversial, many Italians still hold faith in their government, awaiting the victory against the Doriot-inspired traitors of Turin and an end to the most brutal civil war in Italian history. \n\n§YPeople may die and power may shift, but Italy will remain§!."
