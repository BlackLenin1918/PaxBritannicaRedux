PB_IST_Last_Leg:0 "Our Last Leg"
PB_IST_Last_Leg_desc:0 "The Italian civil war has been a long conflict. Many men have died. Many guns have failed their users. Many boys have been sacrificed for the greatness of Italy. All is in vain. \n\nWe have been cornered into Savoy by the Italian army, our cause lost in the eyes of those loyal and those opposed. We're on our last leg now and it will only take a swift kick to the knee for us to fall."

PB_ITA_treaty_of_anzio_1_desc:0 "While Italy did support the Entente at the end of the war, it was always clear that this loyalty was forced upon Italy through Entente pressure. Thus, Italy had to pay for their crimes against the winning powers of Europe and for joining the Bourbon-alliance against the Entente powers. However, due to Italy’s support in the later years of the war, the great powers actively decided to not unreasonably punish Italy, like they did with France. Instead, Italy was forced to demobilize its army and put future restrictions upon its army, such as restricting the use of chemical warfare and experimental tank warfare. The Italian navy and airforce also were decreased due to the treaty and Italy had to pay a small amount to the winning powers."

Eventual agreements have given way to loosening the rules of Anzio, allowing Italy to combat the current neo-imperialist splinter with an armed force."
PB_ITA_Considerable_Political_Violence:0 "Unstable Young Democracy"
PB_ITA_Considerable_Political_Violence_desc:0 "Despite adopting some liberal and progressive ideas of democracy and liberalism prior to the Great War, Italy's experience with democracy has been limited at best, hindered by the previous absolutist tendencies of the monarchy and the surpression of liberalism under the previous regime. However, the Great War left the Italian people without any faith in the traditional system and the old monarch resigned, leaving Gerdinand III to handle the aftermath. Combined with the general distrust of the Bourbons post-war in the UK and Germany and it became a recipe for governmental and societal change. Italy, if it liked it or not, would be dragged towards democracy by the allied powers, despite its kicking and screaming. \n\nWith the establishment of Italian democracy in 1912 and the PLI coming to power, Italian society would experience extensive changes. The wind of liberalism swept across the country: young women ditched conservative clothing for more fashionable and slightly revealing options, young men went against the grain and listened to British and German jazz and a fair few cities even became hotbeds of these new age ideas. Experimentalism regarding politics, identity and sexuality are palpable in Rome, Pisa and other big cities, showing the societal changes that have occured with our new democracy, something some celebrate and others detest. \n\nHowever, young democracy is never stable. The late 20s and the economic stagnation of the era turned the people sour. As unemployment grew, so did extremism. The growing blueshirt movement on one end of the spectrum and the jacobin movement on the other, Italy would turn into a battlefield between these two extremes. Paramilitary groups of many jacobin, socialist, nationalist and imperialist groups dominated the streets for years. Violence would soon turn to treason and the ANI, with the support of the French, staged a violent coup d'état in 1929, kickstarting the Italian Civil War. \n\nViolence has characterized our younger years, but perhaps it's time to grow up and confront these demons."

PB_ITA_Slow_Recovery:0 "The War Crawl"
PB_ITA_Slow_Recovery_desc:0 "Italy has only recently unified under the rule of the Bourbons and, is thus, quite agrarian compared to other European powers. Where the British, French and Germans heavily invested to industrialize as fast as possible, Italy had to deal with others problems surrounding the economy, such as the fuedal-style relations between farmers and landlords and other inefficencies in the agricultural system. Industrialization only started slowly in the early 20th century, only to be hindered by the eventual Great War and the vast economic consequences this war would have. \n\nDespite its agricultural nature, Italy was able to musture a force equal to the other European powers and fight on almost equal footings to them. However, compared to France, Britain and Germany, Italy would continue to feel the economic and financial consequences of the war deep into the 30s, with a vast government debt, many young men killed in the war and infrastructure in a relatively bad state. Vast reforms would follow the rule of the PLI with the liberalization of the market, leading to an increasingly bad position for the agricultural sector. In 1933, the economy is still crawling towards recovery with many farmers either leaving their farms for the city or leaving Italy altogether for the New World, hoping to find a new way of life there. Untill active measures are taken, Italy will continue to suffer under the heavy problems left by the war."

italyforeign.1.t:0 "Second Rome Declaration"
italyforeign.1.d:0 "Few Italians could have ever thought of such a dire situation, yet Italy has found itself stuck in precisely that. With the French army knocking on the doors of Naples, the government has been forced to make a painfull decision if it wants to preserve Italian sovereignty in the near future. \n\nToday, in a public adress to the people of Rome and any Italian with a cheap radio, king [ITA.GetLeader] has informed the nation of the government's decision, one taken in the name of the king and Italy. During the short 30 minutes adress, the king informed the public that the war has developed to a truely unbearable situation and Italy was forced to choose between its continued existence or existing under the French boot. In the last 10 minutes of the adress, the king told the people that Italy has abandoned the British and Germans and now supports France in its war against the two empires. \n\nThis Second Rome Declaration has clearly divided Italy, as people across the country now protests against the government and its decision, fearing that this decision will seal Italy's faith under the French thumb."
italyforeign.1.a:0 "May God have mercy on our souls..."
italyforeign.2.t:0 "The French force our Hand"
italyforeign.2.d:0 "While we have given our former allies ample time to leave our territory after the Second Rome Declaration, the French have finally forced our hand into joining the conflict on their side. While many Italians still protest us declaring war on our former allies, we simply do not have any choice in the matter anymore."
italyforeign.2.a:0 "We must honour our new deal"
italyforeign.3.t:0 "Helping Hand from Italy?"
italyforeign.3.d:0 "With relations between Italy and Britain having been rather cordial since the end of the Great War, the recent visit from Italy's ambassador wasn't unexpected. Yet his proposal was far less orthodox. \n\nItaly, weary of its place in the world and Europe, seeks to formalize a military pact with London and join the Imperial Powers. Their proposal shows the growing fear on the continent of France and its revanchism, so perhaps an Italian ally could proof to be worthwhile."
italyforeign.3.a:0 "We welcome them with open arms!"
italyforeign.3.b:0 "We don't need known backstabbers..."
italyforeign.4.t:0 "Britain blocked our proposal"
italyforeign.4.d:0 "In a rather shocking twist of events, the British have rejected our proposal, leaving us empty handed and without an ally."
italyforeign.4.a:0 "That's quite bad..."
italyforeign.5.t:0 "Ultimatum from Naples"
italyforeign.5.d:0 "The recent change of regime in Italy has been watched with worrying eyes from the Holy See. With the new secular and jacobin government, many expected that the Vatican would quickly become the target of this new revolutionary regime. They were correct. \n\nThe Italian government has given the Holy See the opportunity to evacuate itself from Rome. They deem the Lateran Treaties illegitimate and see the current kingdom of God in Rome as an illegal occupation of Italian ground by reactionary forces. While we may count on the backing of a few big nations, it isn't certain if they would truely dare to start a war over a little piece of ground in Rome."
italyforeign.5.a:0 "The time has come, we will pack our stuff"
italyforeign.5.b:0 "We won't go quietly! Deus Vult!" 
italyforeign.6.t:0 "The Vatican gives in"
italyforeign.6.d:0 "the Pope has finally come to terms with the reality of progress: as humanity moves away from the need of medieval superstition, his entourage can't simply occupy a sovereign part of Italy."
italyforeign.6.a:0 "The Vatican enters the dustbin of history"
italyforeign.7.t:0 "The Vatican defies our ultimatum"
italyforeign.7.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the Pope cannot live in our simple reality and thinks he can oppose our demand. Our troops are moving into Rome to occupy the Holy See and take the Pope prisoner, while the nations loyal to the Pope either watch in horror or intervene in our domestic affairs."
italyforeign.7.a:0 "The old fool just couldn't accept it"
italyforeign.8.t:0 "Intervene in Monaco?"
italyforeign.8.d:0 "The Italian government has suddenly taken a militant approach to its relationship with the Principality of Monaco, seeking to occupy the small kingdom over ideological reasons. While the new jacobin government hasn't been extremely cordial with the Germany Empire, intervening over such a small country is probably not in our best interest."
italyforeign.8.a:0 "Monaco can fend for itself"
italyforeign.8.b:0 "We won't back down, send a letter to Italy!"
italyforeign.9.t:0 "Germany stands with Monaco"
italyforeign.9.d:0 "The Germans have apparantely taking offense to our plans for Monaco, informing us recently that any attack on the small gambling den of Europe would provoke a German military response. While some radical elements of our government continue to see that we invade the little kingdom, many more see this as a clear sign that we should probably back down instead of provoking a potential conflict with the Germans."
italyforeign.9.a:0 "Losing honour is better than losing lives"
italyforeign.9.b:0 "We won't back down that easily!"
italyforeign.10.t:0 "Germany leaves us to the Italians"
italyforeign.10.d:0 "Recent news from Germany has confirmed the worst: the Germans did not really mean their guarantee of independence and our now backing down, fearing that Italy will commit to invading Monaco and potentially sparking a continental conflict. With the situation this dire, we must make a decision."
italyforeign.10.a:0 "Monaco is lost, give in to the Italian demands"
italyforeign.10.b:0 "Our little casino isn't done yet"
italyforeign.11.t:0 "The Government Resigns"
italyforeign.11.d:0 "With the recent decision to betray our popular British and German allies and sell our country to France in the hopes of keeping our sovereignty, the government has found itself immensely unpopular. Politicians loyal to the cabinet are bombarded with eggs on the steps of parliament and death threats are found written on the walls of Naples. After carefull consideration, the government has presented its letter of resignation to [ITA.GetLeader], stepping down to make place for a temporary crisis government. \n\nWith the old government gone, the army has taken up the tasks of government. With Badoglio at the head of this government of national crisis, the army has diverted the resources and attention of the previous government to the war effort. Progressive laws that were previously passed have been temporarily suspended and now make place for emergency rules, suspending many civil liberties as to keep the country stable throughout the next months of the war. The new government is just as unpopular as the old one, but the army can perhaps make the difference needed after the recent shock of the Second Rome Declaration."

italyforeign.12.d:0 "A product of the Risorgimento 

italyflavour.1.t:0 "Birth of Mediterranean-Style Jazz"
italyflavour.1.d:0 "The Italian youth has always been enjoyers of the Anglo music genre imported from the Americas known as jazz, with hundreds of coffee clubs and jazz houses across the country swinging with the soft tone of the music. With this popularity came the eventual try at replicating the same sense of smoothness in Italian music, with musicians such as Carlo Andreis bringing smooth piano and bass to many forms of regional music. With many clubs now following in his footsteps, a new genre of jazz has been born in our country: Mediterranean-style jazz. \n\nBasing its main themes and smoothness on the American-style of jazz, Mediterannean-style is known for its embracing of the local musical culture and instruments to produce a fairly unique form of jazz. While one plays Neapolitan jazz mainly on the local mandolin with various usage of the tambourine, Genoan Mediterannean-style is more true to its American counterpart though still has its roots in the folk tradition of Trallalero. The intensely different forms of Mediterannean-style jazz has given it a different character from the more freestyle form of American jazz, as it syncretizes free style with tradition, allowing for a magical experience for many young Italians."
italyflavour.1.a:0 "Coffee, jazz, what more does a lad need?" 

italy.1.t:0 "London Crash hits Naples"
italy.1.d:0 "Headlines in the Daily Mail, the World and Naples Affairs all scream today about the same thing: the London Stock Market has crashed and the rest of the world follows in its footsteps. As the British economy retreats into its shell and international trade decreases, Italian traders also seem to notice similair patterns expand to other major nations. As trading partner after trading partner dissapear, Italian producers are slowly losing their clients, leaving them with cars, tesla coils, food and other produce left in the backrooms of factories. Within a few weeks, many Italians start feeling the same thing the British felt that fateful week. \n\nEconomists quickly noticed patterns emerge in Italy's economy. Trade and production decreased, unemployment increased. The few economic interventions of the government did nothing to control this expanding crisis. 14 days had passed since the London Crash when economists and politicians alike uttered the phrase: \"economic crisis\". \n\nItaly's war crawl has expanded itself into a full-blown economic crisis and drastic measures will be needed to pull us out of this situation."
italy.1.a:0 "My God!"
italy.2.t:0 "Uniting the United Socialists"
italy.2.d:0 "A slight breeze blew through the streets of Genoa as Turati and Rosselli met at the café. With a cappuccino in both of their hands, the two men of the PSU started talking about the direction of the party. \n\n\"It's truely something to marvel at Turati, the fact that you were able to get the PSU into the seat of power is commendeable and it opens up the path towards extensive and revolutionary reform\". Turati nodded, agreeing with the idealism of Rosselli about the future. \n\n\"Your enthusiasm is exactly the reason why I am here in Genoa, Rosselli. The PSU, despite its factionalism, has been able to gain power through the democratic method, confirming that revolution is possible by the ballot, not just by the rifle. However, much is to be done and especially the factionalism in the party can neuter our possibilities. That's why I'm seeking to form an united front with you inside the party\". \n\nRosselli did not wait long to answer, sharing a firm handshake with the new prime minister. The party was secured for the future."
italy.2.a:0 "A necessary step towards socialist reform"

italy.100.t:0 "Vanzetti's Revolution"
italy.100.d:0 "Gathering details in these chaotic times is a task for too complicated for most journalists. While some may claim that it was Vanzetti and his anarchists that kickstarted the conflict in Italy, others blame it on the United Front that has been formed in defense of Vanzetti's anarchist idealism. Whatever the truth may be, it remains certain that Italy has now been embroiled into a deadly civil conflict. \n\nAs the anarcho-syndicalists, anarcho-communists and other libertarian socialists have picked up their rifles and dug their trenches across the peninsula, the international community now looks to the main man of this revolution: Bartolomeo Vanzetti. Once a rather ordinary man, Vanzetti became a prominent figurehead of the libertarian socialists of the Italian jacobin political scene. His fervour would gain him the place of chairman when the party won the national election for the first time, yet it became increasingly clear that Vanzetti wasn't planning to just play by the rules of this democratic, capitalist and highly corrupt system. No, for he was the common man and the common man did not play by the rules of the capitalist. \n\nWith Vanzetti's plan to remodel Italy into his own image in full swing, the internatioinal community now looks in terror, awaiting the potentially terrifying results from this new civil conflict in Europe."

ITA_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Kingdom of Italy§! is a secondary continental power \n\nThe Italian peninsula has known decades of unrest, divided by the former city-states and hegemonic powers of Europe, such as Austria, France and Spain. This playball of the European powers would make it the ideal place for unification under a Bourbon monarchy, which would happen in 1871 after the end of the §YTurin campaign§! of the French empire and the §YKingdom of Two Sicilies§!, uniting Italy under a Southern Bourbon powerhouse. Prior to the Great War of 1905, the Bourbons of Italy continued to support the French and Spanish Bourbons in European geopolitics, but such support did not gain any support from the urban elite and university intellectuals, which all supported British ties. This divide, known in the history books as the §YQuestion of Loyalty§!, would haunt Italy to the very end of the Great War. \n\nItaly, as a member of the Bourbon Pact, would support France and Spain in the Great War, fighting on the mountains of Tirol and in the deserts of Libya. The fighting quickly took a toll on the Italian nation, as social unrest grew to a boiling point. Being cut off from Asian and South American food imports and the British landing in Sicily would eventually be the turning point for Italy, as the pro-British administration forced the king to end the Bourbon alliance in 1907, announced during the 21st of May §YRome Declaration§!. These series of events would have most likely doomed France, as, while Italy's army was not quite as modernized as the French or Spanish army, would open up a new front for the French army. \n\nDuring the peace negotiations at the end of the Great War, Italy would not be held accountable for most of the damage done during the Great War, having to pay only for the British naval losses in the Mediterannean. The Italian navy and airforce were also cut down to size, but the Italians were allowed to keep their colonies and were even give the city of Nice from France. Due to the rather soft approach towards Italy from the allied nations, Italian politics would never devolve to such a point of hyper-nationalism, comparable to the French Republic. \n\n§YThe Kingdom of Italy§! is a §Ysecondary power§!"

Coming from a grand family (in both prestige and general size), Ferdinand was often in the spotlight, overshadowing his lesser brothers and sisters as the eldest and the potential heir. This relationship would isolate Ferdinand from most of his brothers, except Carlos, which he would later appoint as the minister of the treasury during his reign. As a young lad, he became a member of the Italian army, 18 years after the hight of the risorgimento in 1971, and would quickly rise through the ranks, not experiencing real combat for a long time. With the outbreak of the §YGreat War§! in 1905, Ferdinand was decorated with many awards and commanded the northern Italian troops from his luxurious house on the hills outside of Naples. While not a military genius, he would prove to be somewhat experienced in strategy and held the Italian-German line for years. Eventually, Italy was forced to switch sides with the §YRome Declaration§! in 1907, resigning Ferdinand from his position on the northern front. Ferdinand III would begin his rule in 1911, when Alfonso gave up his throne after having betrayed his allies. Ferdinand's charmastic personality would help Italy stay relatively united after the Great War, but even his personality can not fix everything, as Italy will soon find out."

#########MISSION TREE
ITA_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "With the defeat of the Italian Kingdom in the Great War and the humiliating Treaty of Anzio, the Italian establishment became weak in the eyes of many. The turbulence that the democratic governments experienced in the '20s still haunt Italy in the '30s, with nationalists and socialists continueing to destabilize. Under the fresh ANI government of D'Annunzio, Italy has yet to truely recover from the economic malace of after the Great War and heal from the political violence terrorizing the streets of Naples, Rome and Milan. Can the ANI truely recover Italian glory?"
ITA_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YFeatures:§!\n    - End the most brutal civil war in Italian history \n    - Win the suspended 1931 election \n    - Pick your allies carefully in the upcoming geopolitical crisis \n    - Modernize Italy and pull it out of the War Crawl \n    - Repeat the Rome declaration and shift the balance of war \n\n§YSituation:§!\n§YThe Kingdom of Italy§! is a nation divided by extremism in 1933.\n\nUnited under the soft, velvet glove of the §YKingdom of Two Sicilies§!, the Kingdom of Italy would become a major European power in the 20th century, playing a pivotal role for the Bourbon war effort. However, despite our greatest efforts, Italy would only experience a pyrrhic victory as the kingdom was forced to change sides by the British in 1907 with the §YDeclaration of Rome§!. \n\nDespite technically ending on the side of the victors of the Great War, Italy wouldn't find itself gaining anything in the following treaties. The §YTreaty of Anzio§! would limit the military capabilities of the nation and declare the Bourbons the sole aggressors of the conflict. However, due to Alfonso's voluntary abdication, the Italian monarchy was spared to reign another day, though limited in their previously absolutist power by a new, liberal parliament formed out of the previous governmental bodies of the Kingdom. \n\nThe 20th century would not become any kinder to Italy, as the Rome Declaration would be seen as a honourless act by many Italian nationalists. The new young democracy, despite the wind of change spreading across Italy's major cities, would have to endure many cases of extreme political violence, as the paramilitaries of the §gANI§! and the §Rvarious jacobin groups§! clashed in the streets, spilling blood every other week. The situation wouldn't improve under the many PLI governments, having trouble to recover from the Great War and suffering under the phenomenon of war crawl, as the agrarian economy of Italy was not able to recover as quickly as the industrialized and modern West European and North American economies. The economic situation synthesizes with the polarisation of Italian politics and would turn the country into a gunpowder barrel, awaiting the spark that would trigger reaction from the radicals. That spark would come in 1929 with an §Yattempted coup d'état in Naples§!, as D'Annunzio's supporters tried to storm the parliament and the royal palace, to no avail. As the government moved to detain D'Annunzio and ban the party, the ANI moved north and kickstarted the §YItalian Civil War (1929-)§!. \n\nAs the blood of Italian brothers and sisters spills in the streets of Florence, Venice, Palermo and Naples, parlement decided to suspend the election of 1931 until the end of the civil war. While far from uncontroversial, many Italians still hold faith in their government, awaiting the victory against the Doriot-inspired traitors of Turin and an end to the most brutal civil war in Italian history. \n\n§YPeople may die and power may shift, but Italy will remain§!."

VANZETTI_DESC:0 "Bartolomeo Vanzetti is the living proof that class should not define one as a person and that the society we live in should end its class-based perspective of the world, instead embracing anarchism as an alternative. Born a fishmonger in Cuneo, Vanzetti had to work to live for his entire childhood. Capitalism and societal traditionalism did not care, however, for profit and status quo were the real goals of both. \n\nAround the age of 16, Vanzetti became involved in the local Piedmontenese labour union scene. A known radical and provocator, the kingdom's regime would soon begin to notice this troublesome man. Yet jail could not tame Vanzetti or even put a dent in his spirit. Instead, his time in jail gave him the contacts needed to thrive in the libertarian jacobin scene of Italy and the rest of Western Europe. From there, he would become a party official of the PSI and its close associates, such as various anarchist groups. Vanzetti would become the face of the PSI's more libertarian minority, while the maximalist majority paid little to no attention to him. Things would change when Vanzetti's bid for party leadership won, leading the party to its first electoral victory and making Vanzetti the first jacobin prime minister of the country. \n\nFrom there, Vanzetti became more and more ambitious. His conspiracy grew to include more radical groups than even the PSI, such as those various little anarchist and revolutionary groups that were close to the party. With the support of them and the radical militias that once supported the king against D'Annunzio, Vanzetti seeks to reform Italy and rid it of state and capitalism. \n\nFor Mother Anarchy may love her sons, but Father Anarchy can make them fight."
