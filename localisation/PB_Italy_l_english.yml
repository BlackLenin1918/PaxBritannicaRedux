PB_ITA_treaty_of_anzio_1:0 "Treaty of Anzio"
PB_ITA_treaty_of_anzio_1_desc:0 "While Italy did support the Entente at the end of the war, it was always clear that this loyalty was forced upon Italy through Entente pressure. Thus, Italy had to pay for their crimes against the winning powers of Europe and for joining the Bourbon-alliance against the Entente powers. However, due to Italy’s support in the later years of the war, the great powers actively decided to not unreasonably punish Italy, like they did with France. Instead, Italy was forced to demobilize its army and put future restrictions upon its army, such as restricting the use of chemical warfare and experimental tank warfare. The Italian navy and airforce also were decreased due to the treaty and Italy had to pay a small amount to the winning powers."

PB_ITA_Considerable_Political_Violence:0 "The Violent '30s"
PB_ITA_Considerable_Political_Violence_desc:0 "Since the end of the Great War, Italian politics have been nothing short of a military battlefield: political murder and brawls happen weekly and the party paramilitaries don’t improve the situation in the slightest. Few even dare to go outside and buy bread at their local bakery, as the possibility of getting caught between the crossfire of the socialists, syndicalists, anarchists, anarcho-liberals, nationalists and imperialists are quite realistic. The political violence has its roots in the ineffectiveness of the democratic government birthed after the Treaty of Anzio, but the violence continues under the ANI of D’Annunzio, as many are united in their struggle against the regime put in place in 1927."
PB_ITA_Slow_Recovery:0 "Crawling Recovery"
PB_ITA_Slow_Recovery_desc:0 "The economic crisis that hit Italy after the Great War was one of the catalysts for the political instability and violence erupting mere months after peace was achieved. The crisis would bring many young men, fresh from the trenches, into a world of pain and no economic security, as many jobs were scrapped and prices continued to inflate at a ridiculous rate. With no prospect of a good future in sight, many either used alcohol to numb the pain of existence or sought to find meaning the extreme ends of the political spectrum: emboldened by a rotting political establishment and full with rhetoric blaming everything and everyone, these movements gave a future for many young men and even women, promising the world. While this all happened, the economy slowly recovered. Extremism would halt this recovery in the ‘20s, as revolutions and strikes kept the economy from recovering, though leading to a general improvement in the lives of many workers. While it has been quite some time since the crash, the economy remains on the back burner in Italy, with slow recovery being the keyword for both the local and national governments."

  # EVENTS
  ##########################
italy.1.t:0 "Death of the Soldier King"
italy.1.d:0 "The city of Rome, and to a certain extend the entirety of Italy, mourns, as Alfonso the first of Italy has passed away in his sleep today, at the old age of 93. While the king has passed away, a feeling of united mourning has cloacked across Italy. However, Alfonso was far from uniting during his lifetime. During the Great War, after countless months of pressure by both his court and his people, Alfonso made the decision to end Italy's alignment with the Bourbon Pact, abandoning his French and Austrian allies during the Great War and joining the British against them. This action, known as the Rome Declaration, would become a dividing subject for the years to come, as many still debate the actual intent of the Rome declaration. Not long after the end of the war, Alfonso I gave up his crown in favor of his oldest son, Ferdinand, who currently reigns our divine nation. The old king is planned to be buried in Santa Chiara, Naples, alongside all his predecessors, such as Francis II."
italy.1.a:0 "Italy mourns for the old king..."
italy.3.t:0 "Opening of the Liberty Bridge"
italy.3.d:0 "Today, Venice was graced by the presence of Ferdinand I as he was present for the opening of the Ponte della Libertà, Italian for Liberty Bridge. The road bridge connects the centre of the city of Venice to the mainland. Designed by famous Italian engineer Eugenio Miozzi, many Venetians were excited to see this construction of the future opened. Today it was opened by the king and became the only vehicular entrance to the city of Venice. Build out of brick and concrete, the bridge is not necessarily pleasing to look at, but it is clearly an icon for the modern times."
italy.3.a:0 "Interesting"
italy.4.t:0 "British Market Crashed"
italy.4.d:0 "Recent news from London has confirmed one of our biggest fears yet: The British stockmarket, the centre of the global capitalist economy, has collapsed. The reasoning behind the crash is not completely clear yet, but the effects have already affected Italy in several ways. British trade has begun to lower dramatically hours after the crash and many British industries set up in Rome have become prime targets of bankruptcy if they do not defend themselves against the rapidly dropping pound. These effects will definetely not help Italy in the future and many have already prepared for the worst economically."
italy.4.a:0 "Sad days will come..."
italy.5.t:0 "Less Trade in Naples"
italy.5.d:0 "It has become increasingly clear that the British stockmarket has been a stab to the global economy, as many mediterranean nations such as Serbia and Greece have begun to lessen their exports to Italy. The ports of Naples were rather empty today and many employees of the trade industry fear unemployment in the next few weeks. The government has made some promises to the public, but many know that they aren't backed by anything. It will cost us dearly if we are not protected for the economic fallout that comes to Italy."
italy.5.a:0 "It will definetely cost us..."
italy.6.t:0 "Mass Unemployment hits Rome"
italy.6.d:0 "Rome, the city of life, has darkened under the social and economic pressure brought by the stockmarket collapse in London. The many workers that once walked across the streets have steadily declined, while the beggars and homeless people patrolling the roads of Rome have increased. Mass unemployment has become not just a local event for Rome, but has already hit several major northern cities. However, while the southern cities lay in their economic comfort, the hardest winds have yet to blow across Italy."
italy.6.a:0 "Dire times"
italy.7.t:0 "Mese Nero"
italy.7.d:0 "Nearly a month has passed since the collapse of the British economy and the subsequent events that halted the slow recovery of the Italian economy after the early 1920s. The month has been one to remember for many, as many workers were laid off and unemployment skyrocketed across every sector known to Italy. This decimation of our economic efforts and the slow recovery the previous liberal government had counted on has been called 'Mese Nero' or 'Black Month' by the most promintent economists in- and outside of Italy. With this black month hitting us during such a daring time, we'll have to put a lot of effort into our economic reconstruction."
italy.7.a:0 "Comparable to a Greek tragedy..."
italy.8.t:0 "Revoking our Maghreb Guarantee"
italy.8.d:0 "The Maghreb Concessions Zone has been memorized by many as the millionth failed British experiment: carved out of the dying French Empire after the Great War, the international zone was supposed to represent the interests of the victors of the Great War. Later, Italy would join the benefactors and guarantee the sovereignty of the international zone. However, it has become clear that this zone wasn't something that benefitted every nation involved in the region, but only the British Empire. Thus, Italy has decided to revoke its guarantee from the Maghreb Concessions Zone, as there's no point in dying for a small, British puppet in the future."
italy.8.a:0 "What do the British think we are? Idiots?"
italy.9.t:0 "The End of Italy?"
italy.9.d:0 "Due to a serie of unfortunate events, Italy has been split between the nations of old that once reigned prior to the rissorgimento. Their fortune is our misfortune, as the old Italian kingdom is no more. The question now remains: Should we continue to claim the legacy of Italy and reconquer the peninsula piece by piece, or accept our fate and rejoice as the kingdom of Two Sicilies under our isolated royal family?"
italy.9.a:0 "Italy is not yet lost!"
italy.9.b:0 "Our roots, we shall never forget..."


italy.36.t:0 "Governor opens the Palermo Highway"
italy.36.d:0 "The local Sicilian governor Cesare Mori and the mayor of Palermo Di Marzo, both having ties with the local ANI branch, recently opened the Palermo highway, a project funded by the Napoli government as to connect the rural island of Sicily between the east and the west. The infrastructure project is, however, not only financially motivated, but also politically: The region of Sicily has always been disconnected from the Italian peninsula due to the strait of Messina, allowing the mafia and separatists to thrive in the region. The new infrastructure layed down could potentially keep the region more connected to its centers and Italy as a whole."
italy.36.a:0 "Bravo"
italy.37.t:0 "Beginning of the Red Months"
italy.37.d:0 "The boys of Rome selling newspapers scream at the top of their lungs, as the headlines of the papers boldy read: 'Socialists revolutionaries occupy northern towns'. While the Italian media is far from factual, the headlines are not wrong. \n\nThe rising political tension and the violence Italy has experienced for nearly 10 years now has boiled over this week, as the murder of Italian socialist Giacomo Matteotti broke the camel's back. Public opinion against the ANI and the blueshirts quickly turned, which was gracefully used by the Italian Socialist Party in their quest of subverting the nationalist government and toppling it through any means necessary. The death of Matteotti led to regional strikes in the north, with few occupying the factories. These loose fractions of the Socialist Party have been unorganized and without a central leader, but the tide could quickly turn if we don't act fast. \n\nIn light of the violence in Northern Italy, Ferdinand III has adressed the public, trying to calm it down and preaching unity. His speech has, however, become the butt of the joke for many socialists and republicans, not caring about any idea of unity or order apparantely."
italy.37.a:0 "Let's hope it doesn't worsen..."
italy.38.t:0 "Death of Giacomo Matteotti"
italy.38.d:0 "Giacomo Matteotti, prominent socialist and anti-ANI activist, has been found dead 23 kilomters north of Rome. His suspected murderers were found shortly after, all of which were members of the Italian blueshirt organization. After stabbing the activist several times in their Lancia Lambda, the blueshirts dumped his body in a creek, hoping that nobody would miss him. \n\nWhile members of the blueshirts, questions on the involvement of Roberto Farinacci remain unanswered, as all suspects currently remain quiet."
italy.38.a:0 "My God..."
italy.39.t:0 "The 18th Milan Congress"
italy.39.d:0 "With the fall of order in northern Italy, the socialist parties involved were invited to the PSI's 18th annual Milan Congress. The congress was focussed on the unification of the anti-ANI forces in the north of Italy through negotiations and ideological debate. While the eventual conclusion of the congress didn't produce an effective bloc against the government, the stepping stones towards further cooperation have clearly been set."
italy.39.a:0 "Shocking"
italy.40.t:0 "Peasant Strikes on the Padan Plain"
italy.40.d:0 "The revolutionary fervour that has infected the north of the country has spread itself away from the cities and into the countryside: socialists and anarchists have spread their ideas to like-minded farmers on the Padan Plain in the north, leading to peasant strikes. The strikes, however, are independent from the strikes in the cities, loosely tied to the political idea of established socialism. Instead, these peasants strike for better working and living conditions."
italy.40.a:0 "Let them strike!"
italy.40.b:0 "We can promise those things, can't we?"
italy.41.t:0 "The Bologna Revolution"
italy.41.d:0 "After several months of violence, strikes and government action, the Italian Socialist Party has declared an end to state surpression of socialists across Italy. In their declaration, the PSI denounces the ANI government and declares itself the legitimate government of all Italian people. Despite being completely ridiculous, the declaration has gathered a lot of support for the PSI in the most left-wing regions of northern Italy, leading to these states joining the PSI in their open revolution against the Roman government."
italy.41.a:0 "They won't last a month!"
italy.42.t:0 "The Turin Agreement"
italy.42.d:0 "After endless meetings, discussions and campaigns, the discussion policy adopted by the government has finally payed off in the form of the Turin Agreement, in which the government promises economic reconstruction and improvement in the current working and living conditions of many workers. While the agreement will lead to an expensive program and has given the impression that the ANI government is weak against internal opposition, the agreement has given us more time and has paved the way for economic reconstruction in Italy."
italy.42.a:0 "A diplomatic victory!"
italy.43.t:0 "The Dissapearance of Giuseppe Bastianini"
italy.43.d:0 "Giuseppe Bastianini has been the first member of the ANI to defect after Balbo's grab to power. Having been a staunch supporter of D'Annunzio's neo-imperialist ideology, the man has been deemed a threat by many in Balbo's clique. However, we won't have to worry any longer. \n\nLast seen the evening before his dissapearance near the German embassy in Rome, Bastianini dissapeared without a trace the morning after. Leaving only small clues behind, Bastianini's fate remains a mystery for the local police department. The investigation has already been shut down before any proper preperations were made."
italy.43.a:0 "I wonder where he went..."
italy.44.t:0 "Attempt on D'Annunzio's Life"
italy.44.d:0 "With the recent end of jacobin violence in the northern region of Italy, D'Annunzio decided that the best way to unify the people was to tour the country and show his face around. According to many in the party, Annunzio could more easily unify the country behind the party if the people knew him personally, so a campaign around the country would do wonders for the ANI. \n\nTurin would be the first and last city for D'Annunzio to travel to, as that evening would take a dramatic turn. An hour after arriving at his stay, D'Annunzio was seen being pushed out his hotel window, landing on the hard tiles of the street below him. The assassin(s) were not found nor seen by anyone. D'Annunzio was quickly taken to a local hospital."
italy.44.a:0 "He miraculously survived his fall!"
italy.44.b:0 "He died due to his injuries shortly after..."
italy.45.t:0 "The Lateran Treaty"
italy.45.d:0 "Since the late 19th century, Rome has known a dillema unlike most cities in the world: having once been the seat of political power for the pope and his Vatican, it had now been reduced to a mere city of the Kingdom of Italy, with the pope as its prisoner and the vatican without sovereignty. This issue has plagued Italy for decades now and we need a solution, as the catholic majority of Italy wants to see the Pope and the Vatican rejoice. \n\nOur solution is the Lateran Treaty, a treaty in which we recognize the full sovereignty of the Holy See and define its borders inside Rome. To smoothen the deal with the Pope, we have decided upon giving a financial convention as to compensate for the loss of territory and property by the Papal States in the 19th century, which will be 750 million lire."
italy.45.a:0 "A small price to pay for salvation"
italy.46.t:0 "The Walk to Naples"
italy.46.d:0 "The country is in chaos, the government in dissaray and the public without faith in the system. All of this, caused by the dastardly jacobins and their violent revolutionary methodes, according to the ANI. However, even the ANI, once a bastion of nationalists, has started to falter under the pressure of the political climate. With D'Annunzio gone and Marinetti as the new captain of Italy, the situation seems to be extremely dire. However, the worst has yet to come... \n\nThe blueshirts have always been an unstable part of the ANI's power formula: armed and trained veterans of war, the blueshirts have been a dangerous faction and many suspected them of eventually committing treason against the state. However, few predicted that it would happen this early. \n\nThis morning, all southern legions of the blueshirts defected from the ANI. In a short speech in Salerno, Achille Starace, chief of staff of the blueshirts, blamed the new approach of Marinetti for the anarchy that had plagued the nation in recent months and declared that D'Annunzio would have never agreed to the futurist gaining power after his death. After this public display of treason, Starace walked with his blueshirt legions to Naples and demanded Marinetti to give up his seat of power. \n\nIt's clear that Starace hopes that the king appoints him as the new PM of Italy, however, Marinetti isn't someone to be outplayed and a telegram has just confirmed the loyalty of the armed forces."
italy.46.b:0 "The army will deal with these hooligans"
italy.46.a:0 "We cannot gamble with the lives of the Italian people..."
italy.47.t:0 "Loss of Sicily"
italy.47.d:0 "News from the south has put a dent in the trust of the people, as the island of Sicily has been lost to advancing enemy forces. Despite our hard work to preserve Italian sovereignty over Sicily, the enemy was able to surprise us with an invasion and occupy this core territory. With the loss of Sicily, many in- and outside the government are starting to question the possibility of a victory in this war, as the enemy comes closer and closer to Naples."
italy.47.a:0 "Don't think about Sicily, think about our victory!"
italy.48.t:0 "Loss of Sardinia"
italy.48.d:0 "The recent invasion of Sardinia has shocked the Italian public, as enemy forces now occupy the island. While the defensive effort of the garrison was unable to keep the enemy at bay, the occupation of the island didn't go without problems, as Sardinian partisans continue to harass the occupiers. \n\nThe loss of Sardinia has made the public question the possibility of an Italian victory, as enemy forces now occupy an integral part of the kingdom."
italy.48.a:0 "Less doubting, more fighting!"
italy.49.t:0 "Ferdinand III flees"
italy.49.d:0 "With the recent rise to power of the Blueshirts and Achille Starace, king Ferdinand III has fled the country, fearing his safety in the anarchy following the violent coup d'état in his country. While the king was quite afraid of a possible jacobin counter-revolution that could cost him his crown, he was personally more afraid of Starace and the blueshirts: the shifting loyalty of the organization and its republican sympathies made the monarch decide to leave his kingdom, fearing to lose his head if left at the mercy of Starace."
italy.49.a:0 "We're now a kingdom without a king..."
italy.49.b:0 "We won't need a monarch..."
italy.50.t:0 "The end of Revolution"
italy.50.d:0 "With the crushing blow at Bologna and the capitulation of the jacobin government, the revolution has been crushed in Italy. With the dreams of the socialists, anarchists, syndicalists and hardline jacobins shattered by the combined forces of the Italian army, the kingdom returns to a somewhat stable state. Gramsci has fled the country, fearing prosecution for his treason and revolutionary activities. Many of the old Bologna government have eithered followed Gramsci's example or have been arrested, leaving the Jacobin Party without proper leadership and the unions without agitators."
italy.50.a:0 "We won, but at what cost?"
italy.51.t:0 "A Funeral of Fake Silence"
italy.51.d:0 "The death of Italy's great leader, Gabrielle D'Annunzio, has left the nation shattered. The ANI party, once proudly unified under the charming aristocrat with aerial experience, now is leaderless. The funeral of D'Annunzio would be the best example of the vacuum left behind, as the big factions inside the party already started their struggle for power while D'Annunzio laid in his open casket. \n\nThe funeral remained relatively uneventfull and silent, untill the goodbye speech of Italo Balbo, D'Annunzio's former party associate and the supposed leader of a military-aligned faction inside the ANI. While his speech wasn't as charming as most before him, Balbo's speech did silently dig into the question of leadership after D'Annunzio. With much care and subtelty, Balbo painted himself as the true successor of Il Vate. This would not sit well with Marinetti, leader of the futurist fraction of the ANI and a radical opponent of Balbo's traditionalist military faction. Marinetti would continue to be silent and thoughtfull during the funeral, but would start to gather his support in the party mere hours after the casket was lowered into the ground."
italy.51.a:0 "Only the dead may rest"
italy.52.t:0 "The next Duce"
italy.52.d:0 "The death of D'Annunzio has been a tragic event for the ANI government, but a serious decision has to be made in these times of grief. With the party split among the factions of Marinetti and Balbo, the council of loyalists, the inner party leadership founded to make important decisions in the wake of D'Annunzio's death, has to decide upon a new leader for the ANI and a next prime minister for Italy. \n\nMarinetti seems like the odd choice for many, having never been one of D'Annunzio's close friends and generally enjoying his time with a group of futurists outside of the party. His faction, however, is the larger faction in the ANI, having absorbed a large portion of the D'Annunzio's old loyalists. Despite the strenght in his faction behind his back, Marinetti lacks support from the army and the blueshirts. \n\nBalbo, on the other hand, is a more traditional pick: having worked hard in the airforce and being a popular military candidate, Balbo has the firepower to back his claim to the seat of prime minister. However, his dictatorial tendency does raise suspicion among the council."
italy.52.a:0 "Marinetti is the clear succesor"
italy.52.b:0 "Balbo will keep Italy safe"
italy.53.t:0 "Massacre in Naples"
italy.53.d:0 "The blueshirts were clearly not prepared for an actual reaction by the government, as the newspapers today describe the total massacre of the former blueshirt squads after the army reacted. \n\nMarinetti, knowing of the situation he was in, decided to stand his ground against Starace and his violent band of blueshirts. The message of Marinetti's defiance in the face of blueshirt aggression lead to the blueshirts walking into Naples, armed and ready for revolution. However, the armed forces had already set up defensive positions in the capital, knowing of the march to Naples. The eventual result was a bloodbath, as thousands of men became trapped between a swiftly made barricade and flanking soldiers. In the end, the streets of Naples were cleaned and the blueshirts dissolved, leaving Marinetti's government unchallenged by the violent squadristi of Italy."
italy.53.a:0 "A toast to victory!"

italy.100.t:0 "Malta Conference - Preperations"
italy.100.d:0 "With the Malta Conference coming closer every day, serious preperations are needed to be made to properly represent our wishes during the conference. While the ANI would prefer a complete end to the Treaty of Anzio and the shame it brings to Italy, most members of the ministry of foreign affairs and the cabinet see the danger in proposing such an extreme idea and are thus in favour of proposing a reasonable demand, loosening the military restrictions put on Italy."
italy.100.a:0 "Propose a reasonable demand"
italy.100.b:0 "Take our chance to end Anzio's shame"
italy.101.t:0 "The Malta Conference"
italy.101.d:0 "Since the end of the Great War, some nations have been limited in their military capabilities due to the treaties imposed on them after the end of the conflict. One of those nations is Italy, a nation that fought alongside France at the beginning of the Great War but choose the right side of history after 1917, leading to their restrictions being some of the least restricting compared to France and Spain. However, the Treaty of Anzio did put restrictions upon the Italian military and, with the rise of the ANI nationalists in Italy, the issue of Anzio has grown to become one of the most important political issues in Italy in the 20th century. To solve this pivotal issue, the Kingdom of Italy has reached out to us, wanting to hold a conference on Malta and discuss a possible improvement of the Anzio situation."
italy.101.a:0 "Okay"
italy.102.t:0 "The Malta Conference - Italy's Demands"
italy.102.d:0 "With the UK delegates meeting with the Italian delegates, the Malta Conference has officially begun. However, before the festivity of the event could properly get a grip on the people attending, the Italian delegation hit the British with their only demand: a complete end to the restrictions put on Italy by the Treaty of Anzio. The demand created a tense atmosphere, as the British delegation privately convened to talk about the demand. With many of the diplomats either shocked or appalled by the demand, the British delegation has seemingly made up its mind on the issue of Anzio."
italy.102.a:0 "Their demands are just..."
italy.102.b:0 "...But far from rational"
italy.103.t:0 "The Malta Conference - Italy's Demands"
italy.103.d:0 "With the UK delegates meeting with the Italian delegates, the Malta Conference has officially begun. While the atmosphere of festivity clouded the rooms of the conference, the Italian delegates charmingly proposed their ideas of the future of Anzio. In their plans, the Treaty of Anzio and its restrictions on the Italian army would be loosened, allowing Italy to expand its armed forces and mobilize faster in the face of continental warfare. The delegates have also highlighted the fact that these demands are not, in any way, meant to allow Italian aggression in Europe or Africa, but only for defensive purposes in the face of French expansionism."
italy.103.a:0 "They're perfectly reasonable demands..."
italy.103.b:0 "...But we won't trust Italy or its army"
italy.104.t:0 "The Malta Conference - The UK Accepts"
italy.104.d:0 "With our demands put on the table in Malta and the UK delegates seemingly sympathetic to the Italian cause, the Treaty of Anzio has finally become a lesser issue for Italy, allowing the reconstruction of the armed forces."
italy.104.a:0 "We won't forget the British and their kindness!"
italy.105.t:0 "The Malta Conference - The UK Disapproves"
italy.105.d:0 "Perhaps it was our brash way of proposal, the unreasonable demand that we made our even the unforgivingness of the British, but the UK has disapproved of our demand."
italy.105.a:0 "Those Anglos won't contain Italy!"
italy.106.t:0 "The Shadow Deal of Tunis"
italy.106.d:0 "The Kingdom of Italy currently remains outside of the European conflict, remaining neutral in this catastrophic war against France. However, the desire to join the conflict does float throughout the Italian government, which has recently made contact with the British ministry of foreign affairs. The Italians made clear that they were willing to join this bloody war, but did state that Italy would most likely not profit from such a pointless conflict and would thus only accept to join the war if the British relinqueshed control of Tunisia over to the Kingdom of Italy. While the demand seems dubious, the prospect of having a second front against France sounds appealing to many."

italy.108.d:0 "Despite the recent disaster of the Tunis deal, the Italian government still remains eager to join the conflict in Europe and has thus asked the UK to join its war effort against France.

In an act, mirroring the first Rome Declaration in 1917, the Italian government declared an end to its alliance with Paris and declared war against the French aggressors, citing their expansion into central Europe as an issue that Italy could not ignore. The news from Rome was faced with mixed feelings, as one half of the population celebrated the end of the ANI government, while the other half were tired of the conflict and had hoped for peace, not another pointless war against France."

With the government lost to warhawks and lunatics and the British surely going to destroy the last remaining bastion of Italian sovereignty, the army under Pietro Badoglio has taken matters into own hands and deposed the mad ANI government. Replacing the old government by a new military junta, Badoglio has promised an end to this pointless conflict of naked, imperialist aggression.

ITA_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Kingdom of Italy§! is a secondary continental power \n\nThe Italian peninsula has known decades of unrest, divided by the former city-states and hegemonic powers of Europe, such as Austria, France and Spain. This playball of the European powers would make it the ideal place for unification under a Bourbon monarchy, which would happen in 1871 after the end of the §YTurin campaign§! of the French empire and the §YKingdom of Two Sicilies§!, uniting Italy under a Southern Bourbon powerhouse. Prior to the Great War of 1905, the Bourbons of Italy continued to support the French and Spanish Bourbons in European geopolitics, but such support did not gain any support from the urban elite and university intellectuals, which all supported British ties. This divide, known in the history books as the §YQuestion of Loyalty§!, would haunt Italy to the very end of the Great War. \n\nItaly, as a member of the Bourbon Pact, would support France and Spain in the Great War, fighting on the mountains of Tirol and in the deserts of Libya. The fighting quickly took a toll on the Italian nation, as social unrest grew to a boiling point. Being cut off from Asian and South American food imports and the British landing in Sicily would eventually be the turning point for Italy, as the pro-British administration forced the king to end the Bourbon alliance in 1907, announced during the 21st of May §YRome Declaration§!. These series of events would have most likely doomed France, as, while Italy's army was not quite as modernized as the French or Spanish army, would open up a new front for the French army. \n\nDuring the peace negotiations at the end of the Great War, Italy would not be held accountable for most of the damage done during the Great War, having to pay only for the British naval losses in the Mediterannean. The Italian navy and airforce were also cut down to size, but the Italians were allowed to keep their colonies and were even give the city of Nice from France. Due to the rather soft approach towards Italy from the allied nations, Italian politics would never devolve to such a point of hyper-nationalism, comparable to the French Republic. \n\n§YThe Kingdom of Italy§! is a §Ysecondary power§!"
ITA_LOSES_CORES:0 "§RThe Kingdom of Two Sicilies will lose all its cores on the Italian peninsula and will only be able to regain them through conquest and embracing Italian nationalism once more."
ITA_DESC:0 "Born as Prince Ferdinand Pius, §Yduke of Calabria§!, on the 25th of July, 1869, Ferdinand III would be groomed to become the succesor of Alfonso I of Italy. Coming from a grand family (in both prestige and general size), Ferdinand was often in the spotlight, overshadowing his lesser brothers and sisters as the eldest and the potential heir. This relationship would isolate Ferdinand from most of his brothers, except Carlos, which he would later appoint as the minister of the treasury during his reign. As a young lad, he became a member of the Italian army, 18 years after the hight of the risorgimento in 1971, and would quickly rise through the ranks, not experiencing real combat for a long time. With the outbreak of the §YGreat War§! in 1905, Ferdinand was decorated with many awards and commanded the northern Italian troops from his luxurious house on the hills outside of Naples. While not a military genius, he would prove to be somewhat experienced in strategy and held the Italian-German line for years. Eventually, Italy was forced to switch sides with the §YRome Declaration§! in 1907, resigning Ferdinand from his position on the northern front. Ferdinand III would begin his rule in 1911, when Alfonso gave up his throne after having betrayed his allies. Ferdinand's charmastic personality would help Italy stay relatively united after the Great War, but even his personality can not fix everything, as Italy will soon find out."

However, it's clear to D'Annunzio's ANI that there's more to the strikes than just paralyzing the government, as the red spectre continues to haunt Europe. The political violence brought on by these strikes and the chaos brought by the anarchists and syndicalists are all symptoms of revolutionary ambitions! \n\nTo keep order and stability in Italy, the ANI will have to either crackdown upon this socialist movement or negotiate a deal with the syndicalists, jacobins and anarchists."

PB_ITA_Break_Strikes_desc:0 "Strikes have been a popular method of fulfulling political goals for the socialists of Europe since the 19th century and with the recent expansion of union influence in Italy, strikes have become a major danger for the government and economy.

However, despite our greatest efforts, Italy would only experience a pyrrhic victory as the kingdom was forced to change sides by the British in 1907 with the §YDeclaration of Rome§!. \n\nDespite technically ending on the side of the victors of the Great War, Italy wouldn't find itself gaining anything in the following treaties. The §YTreaty of Anzio§! would limit the military capabilities of the nation and declare the Bourbons the sole aggressors of the conflict. However, due to Alfonso's voluntary abdication, the Italian monarchy was spared to reign another day, though limited in their previously absolutist power by a new, liberal parliament formed out of the previous governmental bodies of the Kingdom. \n\nThe 20th century would not become any kinder to Italy, as the Rome Declaration would be seen as a honourless act by many Italian nationalists and Bourbon sympathizers. The eventual coming to power of the §YANI§! did not improve political polarisation, as the rise of a far-right government gave way to a far-left reaction, sabotaging the aparatus of government. The involvement of the §YBlueshirts§! would be the cherry on top of this giant cake of chaos, making 1930s Italy one of the more unstable regions of Europe."
