  FACTION_IMPERIAL_POWERS:0 "§YMember of the Imperial Powers Alliance§!"
  FACTION_IMPERIAL_POWERS_LONG:0 "This nation is a member of the §YImperial Powers§!, the remnant of the Anglo-German Alliance during the Great War. Founded originally by the German Empire, the leadership of the Imperial Powers shifted towards London following the end of hostilities and the European Economic Crash. A shadow of its' former self, the Imperial Powers is now little more than a mutual defense alliance between the British Commonwealths and their aligned states."

  FACTION_REVANCHIST_PACTE:0 "§YMember of the Pacte Revanchiste§!"
  FACTION_REVANCHIST_PACTE_LONG:0 "This nation is a member of the §YPacte Revanchiste§!, a provisional military alliance established by the French Republic in 1929. Though initially only consisting of France, the alliance is part of a greater ambition of the French state to expand their military reach across Europe. With France's diplomatic isolationism waning, it seems likely many nations might look to their Pact of Revenge for guidance."

  FACTION_PAN_ASIAN_FRONT:0 "§YMember of the Pan-Asian National Revolutionary Front§!"
  FACTION_PAN_ASIAN_FRONT_LONG:0 "This nation is a member of the §YPan-Asian National Revolutionary Front§!, or Han'ajia kokka kakumei sensen, a military alliance established by the Republic of Japan in the late 1920s. Espousing a doctrine of Asian self-determination and rebellion, the Pan-Asian Front is the conduit by which Japan expands their influence across Asia. The idea of \"Asia for Asians\" has become very alluring to many, as the region remains largely dominated by the British, German and Dutch colonial dictates. Depending on the leadership of the Japanese state, this alliance may act as a legitimate force for unity, but in the wrong hands could easily be used to enforce the dominance of Japan's revolutionary government."

  FACTION_UNITED_EMIRATES:0 "§YMember of the United Arab Emirates§!"
  FACTION_UNITED_EMIRATES_LONG:0 "This nation is a member of the §YUnited Arab Emirates§!, or al-'Imārāt al-'Arabīyyah al-Muttahidah, a union of Arab states formed following their emacipation from the Ottoman Empire in 1925. Rather than being a conventional military alliance, the United Emirates functions more like a Confederation of nations akin to the former Holy Roman Empire. Emirs are de-facto vassals of the Emir of Mecca and Hejaz, but in practice they are given significant autonomy due to tribal and dynastic rivalries. While this system has bought stability, it has also precipitated conflict between the Arab tribal dynasties over the perpetual re-elections of the Hashemites."

  FACTION_NORTHERN_COMMITTEE:0 "§YMember of the Northern Defense Committee§!"
  FACTION_NORTHERN_COMMITTEE_LONG:0 "This nation is a member of the §YNorthern Defense Committee§!, a military alliance formed between the Kingdom of Sweden and the newly independent Finland in 1924. Essentially just a pact to deter Russian adventurism in Finland, the Northern Defense Committee has limited ties with Norway and Denmark, though the two are not officially protected by it. With Sweden's historic neutrality broken by their support of the Finns, the NDC is likely just the beginning of Sweden's opening to the larger world."
