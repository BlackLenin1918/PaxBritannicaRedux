PB_MAR_begone_thought:0 "The Modernisation Pressure"
PB_MAR_begone_thought_desc:0 "According to the Arthashastra, one has to excel in war if one is forced into it, with only good rulers being the ones that come out on top in the end. While this passage, and in general the books covering war, is still respected by many in our cabinet, only a few follow its teachings. Political treachery, corruption and general plotting under the boy king of Gwalior has been a chain on our military capability, with only a number of generals and commanders trusting anybody. This distrust by political disagreement has also affected the military innovation of the confederacy, as many generals cling onto the old ways and traditional style of warfare, which has become a great problem in the face of European expansionism in India proper, as shown during our war with the Portuguese in the 1910s."
PB_MAR_mercenaries:0 "Great Reliance on Mercenaries"
PB_MAR_mercenaries_desc:0 "Since the Anglo-Marathan Wars, the Confederate Army of Maratha has existed primarily out of highly trained and disciplined mercenaries from across the globe. Arabs, Sikhs, Rajputs, Sindhis, Rohilas, Abyssinians, Pathans, Topiwalas and even Europeans fight for the Marathan Confederacy if the price is right and their skills are noted by even great European generals, such as the French general Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau and the British Duke of Wellington, Arthur Wellesley. Surely, we're completely unbeatable with such a great collection of men fighting for us, right? \n\n§RWe shouldn't get attached to them...§!"
PB_MAR_divided_by_generals:0 "Semi-Feudalist Administration"
PB_MAR_divided_by_generals_desc:0 "Inspired by the tradition of giving semi-autonomous pieces of land to the most noble of knights of the Marathan Army, the Confederacy still continues a policy of granting provinces to its most worthy generals, dividing the nation into several small military cliques. These cliques, while still having to answer to the central hand of law in Gwalior, have their own ambitions inside the empire and make life difficult for any central tax collector."
PB_MAR_INC:0 "Pan-Indian Congress"
PB_MAR_INC_desc:0 "§GAs we open the first Pan-Indian Congress meeting, we should all remember why we're here. Not for a desire for empire, or economic prosperity for the highest classes, but for the unification of all Indians, regardless of religion or caste, as to all prosper under the Indian sun§!\n\nThe Pan-Indian Congress was founded around the 1890s, inspired by the various revolutionary and underground Chinese movements based in Hong kong and Macau, dedicated to reform Chinese society to western liberal standards and repealing the imperialists from Europe. Their goals were shared by a new Indian student population, united in national identity and, mostly, on Hindu religion. The movement saw a rise to fame with the death of its leader Dadabhai Naoroji at the hands of the brutal Gwalior military police. His death as a martyr would embody the main driving force of the Pan-Indian Congress against the absolute monarchy ruling from its marble palace in Gwalior. Though divided to the core, the congress currently shows an unnatural unity among party members against the crown."

PB_MAR_industrial_question:0 "Scattered Industrial Focus"
PB_MAR_industrial_question_desc:0 "Under the young Scindia ruler, the court and the group of 8, which functions like an advisory organ for the king, have often had contrast in their ambitions regarding industrialization. While no one soul in the court is against industrialization, the inefficiency of the central government has made it really hard to consistently focus on a single sector or branch to industrialize in Indian society. From the shores of Orissa to the deserts of Punjab, industrialization has been a mess and is spread across the nation, leading to no real center of power in terms of industrial might. The underhand tactics of the local elite really work against national interests, it seems."

PB_MAR_PIC_aggression:0 "Pan-Indian Congress Conflict"
PB_MAR_PIC_aggression_desc:0 "As the days pass by, the many people of the Marathan Confederacy feel the tension that is brewing among them. Political unrest has manifested itself in our way of life and the Pan-Indian Congress are to blame for that, as their violent guerilla war against the Scindia dynasty continues to lead to more and more damage and death. Their militant wing under the Bose dynasty has been operating in Gwalior and Bombay for years now, while their more political branches are winning the hearts of the people in this war of terror against the reigning monarchy. \n\n§RWe cannot afford compromise.§!"
PB_PIC_attack:0 "PILM Attack"
PB_PIC_attack_desc:0 "The PILM (Pan-Indian Liberation Militia) has been the suspect of several attacks on the cities of Bombay, Delhi and Lashkar. Led by Rash Behari Bose, this branch of the PIC has been notably jacobin and revolutionary, distancing themselves from the main political organs of the PIC by applauding the Japanese revolution and fearing European liberalism as another tool of imperialism and colonialism. Their war on the monarchy has been rather unpopular, as they have killed innocent bystanders in the past. The PIC have recently distanced the party from the militia, but ties are still keeping the two together."
MAR_RANDOM_EVENT:0 "§RThe PILM will have prepared an attack against our government after 50 days§!"

mar.1.t:0 "Local leader assassinated by the PILM"
mar.1.d:0 "According to the story of our quick central messenger, a local lord and acting governor has been killed by radicals, loyal to the Pan-Indian Congress and its militia under Bose. His death has caused local unrest and a new power vacuum over which the regional lords fight to fill in. His assassins were unable to be captured alive, as they both killed themself before the guards could catch them."
mar.1.a:0 "Bummer"
mar.2.t:0 "PILM sabotages important railway"
mar.2.d:0 "With some delay, our central messenger was able to tell our monarch and his court about the recent PILM activity in the countryside. Local farmer militias had damaged several important points in the regions infrastructure, most importantly the railway, halting trade, transport and communication in the region to a rather slow degree. Those responsible for the sabotage have yet to be identified and caught."
mar.2.a:0 "Total chaos"
mar.3.t:0 "Mercenaries bribed by the PILM"
mar.3.d:0 "After a long time of no communication with a known mercenary band hired by the government, our central messenger has uncovered the truth of this silent division: After questioning local farmers, our messenger has been able to tell us that our former mercenary division has been bribed by members of the PILM and have joined the group to fight against the local government. We'll probally hear something about this band later, if the PILM failes to actually pay these skilled mercenaries."
mar.3.a:0 "A temporary setback"
mar.4.t:0 "PILM harasses farming community"
mar.4.d:0 "Our central messenger has recently told us about a horrendous event that happened on the countryside: a band of PILM militiamen have harassed and raided a big farming community outside Delhi, plundering the houses and stealing every last cent they could find, as to invest into their own war. The local villagers and farmers are also nowhere to be find in the region and many in court suspect that the PILM have recruited them into their army by force."
mar.4.a:0 "What a shame"
