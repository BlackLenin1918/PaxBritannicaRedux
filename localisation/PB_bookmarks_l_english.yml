 PAX_BRITANNICA_NAME:0 "The Shattered Continent"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The old European order, so carefully maintained by armies of diplomats and politicians, was shattered in 1905 by the Great War. Europe once again became the theater of incredible violence as millions died in the trenches, and in the end all that was truly achieved was the worst economic depression in recent memory and the end of France's continental power. Europe is once again falling into armed camps, all that's needed now is a spark to light the powderkeg."
 
 PAX_BRITANNICA_REGIONSTART_ASIA:0 "The Suffering East"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_REGIONSTART_ASIA_DESC:0 "The Far East is a land at a crossroads, with the nascent Japanese Empire strangled in the crib and a moribund China on the brink of the collapse, it seems the only stability to be found is under foreign banners. Times are changing, however, and the once infallible power of Europe is fading. A Red Sun is rising over Asia, poised to strike down the perfidious European imperialists once and for all, liberating the Asian people whether they like it or not."
 
 ENG_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The British Empire, once the undisputed ruler of the world, stands at the weakest point in their long history. The Great War broke the old Concert of Europe, once so dutifully maintained by diplomats and leaders. Britain, caught up in the conflict, sacrificed millions of their soldiers across the French and Iberian fronts. While Europe languished in their postwar depression, Britain retreated into isolationism, relying on an increasingly disfunctional system of imperial trade. With their Imperial Confederation appearing archaic and the Constituent Commonwealths more assertive, Britain faces a myriad of threats with and without."
 FRA_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "Rising from the ashes of their catastrophic defeat in the Great War, France is a nation reborn. The failures of the Bourbon dynasty have paved the way for the rise of ultranationalist fervor. Germany and Britain have suffered weakness and failure, while the peoples of France waited, regaining their strength. Under the guiding hand of Grand Marshall Doriot, France is once again able to stand up to the perfidious Germans and reclaim her rightful place as Europe's dominant power."
