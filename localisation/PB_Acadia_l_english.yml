ACD_society:0 "Diverse yet Unequal"
ACD_society_desc:0 "The State of Acadiana has been an incredibly diverse region compared to most states of the United States. While the Anglo populace has most of its political power, demographically, its barely 10%. The majority of the state population is made up by the sons and daughters of the former French colonists of Louisiana, known as Acadians or Louisiana Cajuns. This group holds some political priviliges, though only those of the confusing non-Creole type of Cajun can hold any office in the state. \n\nThis brings up the question of Creole, as it formerly was used as to describe any Cajun, no matter his race, born after the failed expulsion of Acadians in Louisiana. Nowadays, however, due to the English being confused by the idea of division based on cultural identity instead of racial features, have appropiated the word into dividing European Cajuns and African Cajuns, using Creole as a term for the French African community of Acadiana. \n\nThis, however, does not even explore the tip of the iceberg of Louisiana demographics, as many Welsch, Irishmen, Native Americans, Croatians, Dutch and former Haitian Frenchmen have started to call Acadiana home, though having to slave under the white Anglo force."
ACD_fucking_anglos:0 "The Burden of Acadiana"
ACD_fucking_anglos_desc:0 "While we may be a subject of the British Empire, Acadiana shares no common history or destiny with its British lords. Our blood is tied to the fields of Normandy and the farms of Corsica: We've sought new life in the New World and have been beaten again and again by foreigners. United in only identity and language, the people of Acadiana are no different than the Irish fighters or Scottish warriors that once fought Anglo oppression. A shared hatred for Britain has fueled populist agendas and keeps the Acadian dream of independence burning like a fire, similair to the passion every Acadian feels, Creole or not, for their republican ties, as they, like the Parisian footsoldier or the Merchant from Bordeaux, are a product of the Great Enlightenment and its philosophy."
