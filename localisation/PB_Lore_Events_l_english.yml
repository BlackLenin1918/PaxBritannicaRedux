lore.1.t:0 "The Rise of the Austrian Reich"
lore.1.d:0 "The Austro-Hungarian Empire was among several nations that sided with the German Empire in the First Great War. For decades, the Habsburg-led multiethnic nation teetered on the edge of collapse, and the Great War would push it over the edge. With repeated failures by the Austro-Hungarian Empire to defeat the Russian forces, the nation became reliant on the aid of the German military. The introduction of Romania to the war further nailed the coffin in any chances of a victory, however pyrrhic, for Austria-Hungary. The final blow came when, betrayed by her long-standing Balkan foes and a socialist Hungarian rebellion, the empire signed a humiliating peace with the Triple Entente.\n\nAs with the other Central Powers, Austria-Hungary found itself in the hands of vengeful foes. The Empire was broken into various ethnic states, chief among which was the newly formed Hungarian Republic. Unlike Germany, Austria did not shatter and fall to sectarian conflict. Instead, it found new purpose under the banner of the Fatherland Front. The Front, formed by Engelbert Dollfuss and bolstered by disgruntled veterans and far-right politicians, soon overthrew the provisional Austrian constitutional monarchy in what came to be known as “Red Saturday.”\n\nIn the interwar, the Front would reform the military of the new “Austrian Reich” and launch a campaign of intimidation and war to reclaim their former territories and dominate the Balkans. The Hungarian parliament was ousted and executed, Slovakia seized from the Czechs, and the Romanian monarchy overthrown. By the mid 1930s, the Reich has become a regional powerhouse, using it’s position to exert influence over Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. With so many of the ancient European empires beginning to show their age, Austria is in a unique position to not just take down her former allies, but to dominate Europe on the whole."

lore.2.t:0 "China \n The Crumbling Republic"
lore.2.d:0 "The Republic of China was birthed from the death of the Qing Empire in 1911. Humiliated repeatedly by the more advanced French Empire during the Opium Wars, the last vestiges of Imperial China fell when Sun Yat-sen’s Xinhai Revolution took control. All was not well for the fledgeling republic, however. Yuan Shikai, head of the Imperial military, had aligned to the Republicans and assured their victory in exchange for the first presidency of the nation. Shikai showed his colors not long after, declaring himself Emperor of a new Chinese Empire. In the subsequent conflict, the Republicans were forced to sign various treaties with the disparate Chinese factions and ethnic groups. Aided by Imperial France, who sought to protect their valuable opium trade in Guangdong, Shikai was eventually deposed and the Republic restored. \n\n China would enjoy a degree of relative peace throughout the interwar. The greatest threat came from within, however, as the Russian Civil War lead to the spread of Communist ideals into Manchuria and, by extension, China proper. The fall of the Soviet forces would do little to dissuade rising Communist figureheads like Li Lisan, who pushed for the creation of a hardline Socialist regime in the Republic. The rise of these communists would, in turn, lead to the rise of reactionaries. Wang Jingwei and his Blueshirts, inspired by the rise of Ultranationalism in Europe, preach ideals of Chinese racial superiority and brawl in the streets. Even the military, through which the Republic was born, seems poised to strike. Similarly, the rise of Japan and the Rising Sun’s imperial ambitions threaten the Chinese nation, and many believe that the wars that gripped the world may soon spread to Asia proper. "

lore.3.t:0 "France \n An Empire in Decline"
lore.3.d:0 "To say that France has suffered a tumultuous history would be an understatement. After the French Reformation of the late 1700s, France retained the Bourbon monarchy, adopting a parliamentary system not dissimilar to that of their British rivals. The Estates-General would come to be the de-facto legislative body of the Kingdom and, as their holdings grew, the Empire. For centuries, France would fight to overturn the hegemony that London fostered, creating for themselves an empire to rival even that of Britannia herself. Not even the unification of their German rivals to the East could bring France down. Not even the loss of the French branch of the Bourbon dynasty to disease and ill health could stop their meteoric rise. It seemed nothing could ever end the delicate dance of the empires of Europe.\n\n That dance would come to a crashing halt on July 4th, 1914, with the assassination of René Vivian by a still unknown member of the Zapatista army in French Louisiana. The shots fired that day sparked a conflict that would bring France to her knees, and would lead to the deaths of millions in the rain-soaked fields of Eastern France. Though she secured her victory, as did the rest of the Triple Entente, it proved phyrric. Germany would fall not soon after peace was declared, and if not for the Franco-British Intervention, Russia might have fallen to the evils of godless Bolshevism. The economic stagnation and instability has been hard on France, and have fermented the rise of radical thought on both the left and right. Tension is rising in France, and it can be felt from bustling Parisian cafes to the quiet country side. Every day, the sound of revolution grows louder."
