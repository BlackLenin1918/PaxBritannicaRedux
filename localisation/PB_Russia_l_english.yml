  RUS_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YRussia§! is the undisputed hegemony in Eurasia in 1933.\n\nRussia has by far seen better days. Though a victor of the Great War this has ultimately amounted into minor gains in the form of territorial expansions. Unlike the then once believed idea that the war was some how going to fix the Russian bear's issues, this was false and folly.\n\nThe incompetent Tsar as a result had retreated into a life of solitude, blaming all his failures on his once considered allies. Though there is still hope for the Russian people, With the Tsar now slowly dying a painiful death the political sphere has begun to shift, everyday a figure of great importance to the Tsar goes missing, a position in government is changed, and one less loyal individual gains power. All know what the outcome will be for the Tsar in the coming days, alive or not.\n\nTime will tell if Russia will once again ascend into glory or fall and crumble like many have before her.\n\nRussia is a §YMajor Power§!."

  POLITICS_Emergency_Duma_DESC:0 "§YTemporary Leadership§!\n\nWith the Tsar dead and no direct claimants of suitable age to take the throne it is unsurprising to say the Duma has assumed responsibility of leading the nation, even if temporary. Riots are numerous, public gatherings are large, and the air is thick with unrest. If a succesor isn't named, legaly or not, all hell will soon break loose."

  POLITICS_Nicholas_II_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!18/3/1868\n\n§YTsar Nicholas§! II has lost all hope and lust for life. Nicholas spends his days resting Vacant and Broken on the Imperial Throne letting his court and country decay apart from his seething hatred for his former allies who he blames for all his tragedies.\n\nAs a result the political situation of the Russian Empire is unstable and weak and a simple flick could collapse the entire nation into degeneracy. Russia needs a strong, confident, and ambitious leader if she is to remain united, and feared.\n\nThe harshest of days are ahead for Russia and one wrong step will spell the end of the so called "§YEmpire Of The Slavs§!"\n\n§RThe German and British dogs will pay the ultimate price for their actions§!"
  POLITICS_Pyotr_Wrangel_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!27/7/1878\n\nA devout Orthodoxian and Neo-Imperialist preacher makes §YPyotr Wrangel§! one of if not the most terrifying individuals to call the Russian colossus home. With the §YTsar§! dead and the Okhrana's position secured as the de-facto leading governemnt there is no telling what this mad man has in plan for Europe, especially the two old orders that are Britian and Germany.\n\nA Great War veteran has garnered §YWrangel§! a comfortable collection of friends in high places and a strong connection with the military. His previous record of being head of the Okhrana has also alleviated his political situation and all seems well in the higher echelons of Russian society as a result.\n\n§RThe German and British dogs will pay the ultimate price for their actions§!"

  PB_RUS_succession_DESC:0 "§RA crisis looms over the horizon of Russia and Nicholas, its Tsar, knows this.§! It is a crisis over his succession created by nefarious individuals who declare that §GAlexei§! is not the rightful heir after §YNicholas’s§! death. And his death is fast approaching, a fact that is undisputed by anyone. §GThe Black Hundreds§! have been vehemently supportive of §GAlexei§! who wishes to fulfill his father’s plans of Russian supremacy and pan-slavic unity. The §gmoderate nobles§! in the empire support the candidacy of §gGrand Prince Kirill§!, cousin of the Tsar and a proponent of returning russia to its old traditions. The §Oindustrialists, “progressives” and even the growing stranniki cult§! have thrown their lot in with the Tsarina, §OAlexandra§!. The Tsar has very important decisions to make before he dies and it is these decisions and their effects that will decide who rules in the aftermath of his death. §RThe crisis creeps closer and closer.§!"
