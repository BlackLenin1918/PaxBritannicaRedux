  RUS_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YRussia§! is the undisputed hegemony in Eurasia in 1933.\n\nRussia has by far seen better days. Though a victor of the Great War this has ultimately amounted into minor gains in the form of territorial expansions. Unlike the then once believed idea that the war was some how going to fix the Russian bear's issues, this was false and folly.\n\n The incompetent Tsar as a result had retreated into a life of solitude, blaming all his failures on his once considered allies. Though there is still hope for the Russian people, With the Tsar now slowly dying a painiful death the political sphere has begun to shift, everyday a figure of great importance to the Tsar goes missing, a position in government is changed, and one less loyal individual gains power. All know what the outcome will be for the Tsar in the coming days, alive or not.\n\nTime will tell if Russia will once again ascend into glory or fall and crumble like many have before her.\n\nRussia is a §YMajor Power§!."

  POLITICS_Emergency_Duma_DESC:0 "§YTemporary Leadership§!\n\nWith the Tsar dead and no direct claimants of suitable age to take the throne it is unsurprising to say the Duma has assumed responsibility of leading the nation, even if temporary. Riots are numerous, public gatherings are large, and the air is thick with unrest. If a succesor isn't named, legaly or not, all hell will soon break loose."

Nicholas spends his days resting Vacant and Broken on the Imperial Throne letting his court and country decay apart from his seething hatred for his former allies who he blames for all his tragedies.\n\nAs a result the political situation of the Russian Empire is unstable and weak and a simple flick could collapse the entire nation into degeneracy. Russia needs a strong, confident, and ambitious leader if she is to remain united, and feared.\n\nThe harshest of days are ahead for Russia and one wrong step will spell the end of the so called "§YEmpire Of The Slavs§!"\n\n§RThe German and British dogs will pay the ultimate price for their actions§!"
  POLITICS_Pyotr_Wrangel_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!27/7/1878\n\nA devout Orthodoxian and Neo-Imperialist preacher makes §YPyotr Wrangel§! one of if not the most terrifying individuals to call the Russian colossus home. With the §YTsar§! dead and the Okhrana's position secured as the de-facto leading governemnt there is no telling what this mad man has in plan for Europe, especially the two old orders that are Britian and Germany.\n\nA Great War veteran has garnered §YWrangel§! a comfortable collection of friends in high places and a strong connection with the military. His previous record of being head of the Okhrana has also alleviated his political situation and all seems well in the higher echelons of Russian society as a result.\n\n§RThe German and British dogs will pay the ultimate price for their actions§!"

  russia1title:0 "Life After Death"
  russia1desc:0 "His mind raged through a mix of emotions. All for the state he remembers, though was it really? The Tsar dead by his very hands, coated with what is regarded as "Royal Blood". The rush was quick and sharp, the feeling of death engulfed his body though his loyalty persevered and so he stood there not as an enemy of the russian people but as a saviour. To the people, the nation, and maybe even Europe?"

  russia3title:0 "Workers Protest"
  russia3desc:0 "At first the protests were minor in scale and relatively repetitive in nature. Though as working conditions worsened and pay decreased they grew more feral by the day, the viscosity only worsened and soon enough Pyotr's inpatience got the better of him. The soliders took their postitions respectively. Not a word was spoken during the ordeal and when the men readied themselves the crowd finally catched on. "There going to shoot us!" Yelled a voice and it all went to shit."

  russia4title:0 "Nothing But Fools And Dreamers"
  russia4desc:0 "The current protests are a honest insult to the so called glory days. Few attend and for those that do they are no longer seen as heroes of the common man, just mere dreamers believing in a change that will never come. A final message will be sent to those that still believe."

  russia5title:0 "Out In The Cold"
  russia5desc:0 "The Russian winter offered little help to Dmitri's declining pulse. In the blistering cold he was left out to die, food for the wildlife if lucky. A simple distrust of the government left him dead. Apparently this so called national party is not one that takes kindly to disagreement. For the people they announced after the Tsar's rather unfortunate death though that was clearly a blatant lie. Now he lays in a pit of rotting corpses, awaiting natures endless cycle of clean up duty."

A petty officer gathered the courage and balls to speak on everyone's behalf, regurgitating the exact same thoughts his fellow officers inhabitated. "[Root.GetLeader]? We stopped receiving communications past Perm. I believe the end is near." The sound of throat movement echoed inside the officer's mouth and the proccess of swallowing saliva played its short and violent course."

The room remained dead silent, even during the final minutes of realisation, then when the atmosphere did break a short insignificant blond haired nurse whispered everyone's exact thoughts.

Any that refuse will be shot and burnt with your ashes returned to your respected families." Then the announcer crumbled the small note he held in his right palm and directly stared into the many glaring eyes that saturated the room. "Me and my men will not hesitate, that is a promise." The entire room's life vanished with the announcers final words and a stampede of overweight, blabbering men rushed for the exit doors."

  russia106desc:0 "A small and insignificant cloaked figure stood on the makeshift podium that the mob had constructed. The crowd for once calmed, and gathered to listen to the preachers words, with every sentence they grew more loyal and interested till they had heard enough. Then the crowd dispersed, rushing various military holdouts with nothing but sheer will. It was a violent show of savage cruelty. Every holdout begun to collapse under the weight of numerous civilians and military defectors storming the streets in a show of religious fervour. The Duma was the last of these locations and it stood as the only buidling defiant to the crowd. The soliders that witnessed the human mass didn't even bother to put up a final defense, it was already over. But the soliders were of no interest to the mob, the oligarchs were, those fat greasy pigs as the crowd called them, and all one could see with the naked eye was a collection of individuals storming the Duma where screams were heard from all throughout the night."
