  RUS_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YRussia§! is the undisputed hegemony in Eurasia in 1933.\n\nRussia has by far seen better days. Though a victor of the Great War this has ultimately amounted into minor gains in the form of territorial expansions. Unlike the then once believed idea that the war was some how going to fix the Russian bear's issues, this was false and folly.\n\n The incompetent Tsar as a result had retreated into a life of solitude, blaming all his failures on his once considered allies. Though there is still hope for the Russian people, With the Tsar now slowly dying a painiful death the political sphere has begun to shift, everyday a figure of great importance to the Tsar goes missing, a position in government is changed, and one less loyal individual gains power. All know what the outcome will be for the Tsar in the coming days, alive or not.\n\nTime will tell if Russia will once again ascend into glory or fall and crumble like many have before her.\n\nRussia is a §YMajor Power§!."

  POLITICS_Emergency_Duma_DESC:0 "§YTemporary Leadership§!\n\n§YUnpopular Oligarchs§!\n\nWith the Tsar dead and no direct claimants of suitable age to take the throne it is unsurprising to say the Duma has assumed responsibility of leading the nation, even if temporary. Riots are numerous, public gatherings are large, and the air is thick with unrest. If a succesor isn't named, legaly or not, all hell will soon break loose."

  russia1desc:0 "His mind raged through a mix of emotions. All for the state he remembers, though was it really? The Tsar dead by his very hands, coated with what is regarded as "Royal Blood". The rush was quick and sharp, the feeling of death engulfed his body though his loyalty persevered and so he stood there not as an enemy of the russian people but as a saviour. To the people, the nation, and maybe even Europe?"

  russia3title:0 "Workers Protest"
  russia3desc:0 "At first the protests were minor in scale and relatively repetitive in nature. Though as working conditions worsened and pay decreased they grew more feral by the day, the viscosity only worsened and soon enough Pyotr's inpatience got the better of him. The soliders took their postitions respectively. Not a word was spoken during the ordeal and when the men readied themselves the crowd finally catched on. "There going to shoot us!" Yelled a voice and it all went to shit."

  russia4title:0 "Nothing But Fools And Dreamers"

  russia5title:0 "Out In The Cold"
  russia5desc:0 "The Russian winter offered little help to Dmitri's declining pulse. In the blistering cold he was left out to die, food for the wildlife if lucky. A simple distrust of the government left him dead. Apparently this so called national party is not one that takes kindly to disagreement. For the people they announced after the Tsar's rather unfortunate death though that was clearly a blatant lie. Now he lays in a pit of rotting corpses, awaiting natures endless cycle of clean up duty."

The room remained dead silent, even during the final minutes of realisation, then when the atmosphere did break a short insignificant blond haired nurse whispered everyone's exact thoughts.
