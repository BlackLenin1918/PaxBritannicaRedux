With the Tsar dead and the Okhrana's position secured as the de-facto leading governemnt there is no telling what this mad man has in plan for Europe, especially the two old orders that are Britian and Germany."

  russia1title:0 "Life After Death"
  russia1desc:0 "His mind raged through a mix of emotions. All for the state he remembers, though was it really? The Tsar dead by his very hands, coated with what is regarded as "Royal Blood". The rush was quick and sharp, the feeling of death engulfed his body though his loyalty persevered and so he stood there not as an enemy of the russian people but as a saviour. To the people, the nation, and maybe even Europe?" 
  russia1opta:0 "Give Him A Rag"
  russia3title:0 "Workers Protest"
  russia3desc:0 "At first the protests were minor in scale and relatively repetitive in nature. Though as working conditions worsened and pay decreased they grew more feral by the day, the viscosity only worsened and soon enough Pyotr's inpatience got the better of him. The soliders took their postitions respectively. Not a word was spoken during the ordeal and when the men readied themselves the crowd finally catched on. "There going to shoot us!" Yelled a voice and it all went to shit."
  russia3opta:0 "Shoot The Bastards!"
  russia4title:0 "Nothing But Fools And Dreamers"
  russia4desc:0 "The current protests are a honest insult to the so called glory days. Few attend and for those that do they are no longer seen as heroes of the common man, just mere dreamers believing in a change that will never come. A final message will be sent to those that still believe."
  russia4opta:0 "There Outnumbered"
  russia5title:0 "Out In The Cold"
  russia5desc:0 "The Russian winter offered little help to Dmitri's declining pulse. In the blistering cold he was left out to die, food for the wildlife if lucky. A simple distrust of the government left him dead. Apparently this so called national party is not one that takes kindly to disagreement. For the people they announced after the Tsar's rather unfortunate death though that was clearly a blatant lie. Now he lays in a pit of rotting corpses, awaiting natures endless cycle of clean up duty."

Every day a shipment of weapons go missing, a politician is found dead, and a once loyal party member has a change of heart. Something is up and if Nicholas's condition doesn't improve then the unthinkable may occur."

  russia28desc:0 "There were visible signs of distress all throughout the room. Sweat breached through the forehead of every man who, by some unfortunate play of events, found themselves waiting in a confined makeshift conference room that was constructed by an ugly combination of peasantry furniture and party memorabilia. A petty officer gathered the courage and balls to speak on everyone's behalf, regurgitating the exact same thoughts his fellow officers inhabitated. "[Root.GetLeader]? We stopped receiving communications past Perm. I believe the end is near." The sound of throat movement echoed inside the officer's mouth and the proccess of swallowing saliva played its short and violent course."

  russia35title:0 "It Only Worsens"
  russia35desc:0 ""What does the medical report read?" Questioned Alex hoping to hear something other than the truth. "Increased sensitivity to light, developing headaches, severe muscle pains, nothing good." Both of them knew what the outcome would be in time though they refused to believe it. It certainly couldn't be caused by natural means. A king becoming the victim of a crime that only inhabited the lower class is rare, what was more confusing was the delays for the needed medication the Tsar so desperately needed. Then it clicked."
