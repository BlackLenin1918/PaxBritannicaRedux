  PB_lost_Son_desc:0 "Tsar Nicholas II has lost all hope and lust for life since The Tragic Death of the Tsarevich Alexei Romanov and The Ensuing Suicide of the Tsarina Alexendra. Nicholas spends his days resting Vacant and Broken on the Imperial Throne letting his court and country decay apart from his seething hatred for his former allies who he blames for all his tragedies."
