  PB_Lost_Son:0 "The Lost Tsarevich"
  PB_lost_Son_desc:0 "Tsar Nicholas II has lost all hope and lust for life since The Tragic Death of the Tsarevich Alexei Romanov and The Ensuing Suicide of the Tsarina Alexendra. Nicholas spends his days resting Vacant and Broken on the Imperial Throne letting his court and country decay apart from his seething hatred for his former allies who he blames for all his tragedies."
  POLITICS_Pyotr_Wrangel_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!07/11/1891\n\nA devout christian and Neo-Imperialist preacher makes §YPyotr Wrangel§! one of if not the most terrifying individuals to call the Russian colossus home. With the Tsar dead and the Okhrana's position secured as the de-facto leading governemnt there is no telling what this mad man has in plan for Europe, especially the two old orders that are Britian and Germany."

It seems impossible but Nicholas might be able to stabilize the situation post recovery though he will need a sturdy hand and cold heart if he plans to do so.\n\n§YEvery seven days or so the Tsar's health may or may not decrease. It is up to you whether he survives or not, if he does then the Tsar shall rule eternal, if not, then a new order will dawn over Russia.§!\n\n§YThe Tsar's health is shown through a system based on variables. 0 means the Tsar is dead while 100 means he is alive and kicking.

  russia1title:0 "Life After Death"
  russia1desc:0 "His mind raged through a mix of emotions. All for the state he remembers, though was it really? The Tsar dead by his very hands, coated with what is regarded as "Royal Blood". The rush was quick and sharp, the feeling of death engulfed his body though his loyalty persevered and so he stood there not as an enemy of the russian people but as a saviour. To the people, the nation, and maybe even Europe?" 
  russia1opta:0 "Give Him A Rag"
  russia3title:0 "Workers Protest"
  russia3desc:0 "At first the protests were minor in scale and relatively repetitive in nature. Though as working conditions worsened and pay decreased they grew more feral by the day, the viscosity only worsened and soon enough Pyotr's inpatience got the better of him. The soliders took their postitions respectively. Not a word was spoken during the ordeal and when the men readied themselves the crowd finally catched on. "There going to shoot us!" Yelled a voice and it all went to shit."
  russia3opta:0 "Shoot The Bastards!"
  russia4title:0 "Nothing But Fools And Dreamers"
  russia4desc:0 "The current protests are a honest insult to the so called glory days. Few attend and for those that do they are no longer seen as heroes of the common man, just mere dreamers believing in a change that will never come. A final message will be sent to those that still believe."
  russia4opta:0 "There Outnumbered"
  russia5title:0 "Out In The Cold"
  russia5desc:0 "The Russian winter offered little help to Dmitri's declining pulse. In the blistering cold he was left out to die, food for the wildlife if lucky. A simple distrust of the government left him dead. Apparently this so called national party is not one that takes kindly to disagreement. For the people they announced after the Tsar's rather unfortunate death though that was clearly a blatant lie. Now he lays in a pit of rotting corpses, awaiting natures endless cycle of clean up duty."

Every day a shipment of weapons go missing, a politician is found dead, and a once loyal party member has a change of heart. Something is up and if Nicholas's condition doesn't improve then the unthinkable may occur."
  russia27opta:0 "God Bless His Soul"
  russia28title:0 "The Collapse Of Russia"
  russia28desc:0 "There were visible signs of distress all throughout the room. Sweat breached through the forehead of every man who, by some unfortunate play of events, found themselves waiting in a confined makeshift conference room that was constructed by an ugly combination of peasantry furniture and party memorabilia. A petty officer gathered the courage and balls to speak on everyone's behalf, regurgitating the exact same thoughts his fellow officers inhabitated. "[Root.GetLeader]? We stopped receiving communications past Perm. I believe the end is near." The sound of throat movement echoed inside the officer's mouth and the proccess of swallowing saliva played its short and violent course."
  russia28opta:0 "What The Fuck!"
  russia35title:0 "It Only Worsens"
  russia35desc:0 ""What does the medical report read?" Questioned Alex hoping to hear something other than the truth. "Increased sensitivity to light, developing headaches, severe muscle pains, nothing good." Both of them knew what the outcome would be in time though they refused to believe it. It certainly couldn't be caused by natural means. A king becoming the victim of a crime that only inhabited the lower class is rare, what was more confusing was the delays for the needed medication the Tsar so desperately needed. Then it clicked."

Both sides want a little bit more land, men, and resources. If this cold-war isn't dealt with then mainland Europe know very well what will occur. \n\nIt was always assured that France's and Russia's ambitions will clash the day their so called pact of revenge formed. Even the Germans knew this, exploiting weaknesses in their communications networks, baiting stubborn generals from both sides, and overall lack of coordination between the powers. Now the time has come to truely test this pact of friendship and revenge. Will they cooperate and conquer or will they hinder and fall? Only time can tell. \n\nYou must balance out the levels of influence and tension to avoid a war with our respected ally, unless war is what you want.\n\n\n                                                            Political Tension: §Y[?POLITICAL_TENSION]§!\n\n French Influence: §Y[?F_INFLUENCE]§!
