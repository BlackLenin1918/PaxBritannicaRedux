Nicholas spends his days resting Vacant and Broken on the Imperial Throne letting his court and country decay apart from his seething hatred for his former allies who he blames for all his tragedies."
  POLITICS_Pyotr_Wrangel_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!07/11/1891\n\nA devout christian and Neo-Imperialist preacher makes §YPyotr Wrangel§! one of if not the most terrifying individuals to call the Russian colossus home. With the Tsar dead and the Okhrana's position secured as the de-facto leading governemnt there is no telling what this mad man has in plan for Europe, especially the two old orders that are Britian and Germany."

  russia1title:0 "Life After Death"
  russia1desc:0 "His mind raged through a mix of emotions. All for the state he remembers, though was it really? The Tsar dead by his very hands, coated with what is regarded as "Royal Blood". The rush was quick and sharp, the feeling of death engulfed his body though his loyalty persevered and so he stood there not as an enemy of the russian people but as a saviour. To the people, the nation, and maybe even Europe?" 
  russia1opta:0 "Give Him A Rag"
  russia3title:0 "Workers Protest"
  russia3desc:0 "At first the protests were minor in scale and relatively repetitive in nature. Though as working conditions worsened and pay decreased they grew more feral by the day, the viscosity only worsened and soon enough Pyotr's inpatience got the better of him. The soliders took their postitions respectively. Not a word was spoken during the ordeal and when the men readied themselves the crowd finally catched on. "There going to shoot us!" Yelled a voice and it all went to shit."
  russia3opta:0 "Shoot The Bastards!"
  russia4title:0 "Nothing But Fools And Dreamers"
  russia4desc:0 "The current protests are a honest insult to the so called glory days. Few attend and for those that do they are no longer seen as heroes of the common man, just mere dreamers believing in a change that will never come. A final message will be sent to those that still believe."
  russia4opta:0 "There Outnumbered"
  russia5title:0 "Out In The Cold"
  russia5desc:0 "The Russian winter offered little help to Dmitri's declining pulse. In the blistering cold he was left out to die, food for the wildlife if lucky. A simple distrust of the government left him dead. Apparently this so called national party is not one that takes kindly to disagreement. For the people they announced after the Tsar's rather unfortunate death though that was clearly a blatant lie. Now he lays in a pit of rotting corpses, awaiting natures endless cycle of clean up duty."
