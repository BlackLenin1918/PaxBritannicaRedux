 russia_pol.1.a:0 "Throw them a bone - allow local elections to occur."
 russia_pol.1.b:0 "Let them waste their time."
 russia_pol.1.c:0 "Crush the protest - such rebelliousness will not be tolerated."
 russia_pol.2.t:0 "Canonization of the Romanov Family?"
 russia_pol.2.d:0 "A number of bishops within the Russian Orthodox Church have discussed the canonization of the deceased Tsar Nicholas II and his family as passion-bearers, for the Christ-like manner in which they faced death during Trotsky's Uprising in 1917. The move will undoubtedly be met with controversy in the way that the permissal of this may be construed as promoting a pro-monarchist sentiment within Russia."
 russia_pol.2.a:0 "Future generations must know the tale of the Romanovs."
 russia_pol.2.b:0 "The failed Tsar deserves no place in history."
 russia_pol.3.t:0 "Alexei Khvostov Holds Pro-Democratic Speech"

 russia_pol.3.b:0 "Disregard this troublemaker."

 russia_pol.4.d:0 "The youngest daughter of Nicholas II has long been the subject of speculation due to the inability for criminologists to locate her remains alongside those of the rest of the royal family, leading many to suspect she had survived and gone into hiding. Today, a woman who had been living under the pseudonym Franziska Schanzkowska finished undergoing careful procedures to determine her identity and was conclusively proved to, in fact, be the real Grand Duchess. Though her father remains controversial, crowds have gathered to almost unanimously welcome her upon her 'return' to Russian society and the public eye."
 russia_pol.4.a:0 "Invite her to the palace immediately- she must have audience with General Kornilov."
 russia_pol.4.b:0 "She is merely a returned reminder of a bygone era."
 russia_pol.9.t:0 "Nestor Lakoba Broken out of Prison"
 russia_pol.9.d:0 "A mid-level Abkhaz socialist imprisoned in the wake of Trotsky's Uprising was broken out of prison today by a group of Bolshevik militants in the midst of rising tensions against the government on the part of Bolshevik Sympathizers."

 russia_pol.10.a:0 "We must devote resources to catching him now."
 russia_pol.11.t:0 "Bolshevik Rally in Yaroslavl"
 russia_pol.11.d:0 "Thousands of people took to the streets today in protest of [SOV.GetLeader]'s government policies and calling for change. Many of the protestors were openly Bolshevik, waving red banners and proclaiming the glory and value of Leon Trotsky's ideals."

Local police in each municipality are already to working to suppress the demonstrations, to moderate effect."
 russia_pol.12.a:0 "A worrying occurence."
 russia_pol.1.t:0 "Tsaritsyn Workers go on Strike"
 russia_pol.1.d:0 "Numerous workers from the Tsaritsyn Tractor Factory, seeking better wages and working conditions, have gone on strike and are protesting against the local and regional government."

This uprising will dwarf the one initiated by Trotsky in 1917."

 russia_pol.14.b:0 "Proletarians of Russia, Unite! [PLAY AS TUKHACHEVSKY]"

 russia_fl.1.t:0 "The Russian State in 1936"
 russia_fl.1.d:0 "The accession of Nicholas II to the Russian throne after his father's untimely death was the catalyst for the fall of Russia from the world stage. Inexperienced with politics and governance, the new Tsar blundered into controversy after controversy. In 1904, the Russian Empire found itself at war with Japan, which ultimately saw the expulsion of Russia from Alaska and Outer Manchuria in the Treaty of Sinaloa. Months later, a revolt against Tsarist rule led to the establishment of the Duma- at the cost of hundreds of protestors killed.\n\nBut by far the greatest blow to Russia was its series of defeats in the First World War. The repeated Russian defeats against the Central Powers' advances led to the February Revolution, deposing the Tsar and installing Russia's first truly democratic government. The provisional government, however, opted to continue fighting the war, further tearing apart Russian society. With Bolshevism rising in popularity among the country, and local Soviets gaining more and more power, Lavr Kornilov moved with a personal army to overthrow the Provisional Government in Petrograd. The ensuing nationwide chaos, aggravated by terrorists and partisans following the teachings of Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin, saw the kidnapping and assassination of the Tsar and much of his family. Realizing that Russia was on the brink of total collapse, Kornilov surrendered to Germany and signed the Brest-Litovsk treaty, the single most humiliating peace treaty in Russia's history.\n\nKornilov has spent the time since the Great War consolidating power and working to stabilize Russia once more, but has made marginal headway into determining the future of Russia. The fall of the Central Powers has created new and vulnerable nations on Russia's western border, and the Central Asian Republics continue to bicker amongst themselves. Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Leon Trotsky are stoking Bolshevik sentiments once more. With the General's health now in decline, a new leader will soon take the reins, carving a new destiny for the once-great nation..."

 russia_fl.5.d:0 "Today, groups of Orthodox bishops from the Russian Orthodox Church, along with groups of prominent monarchists, convened in Tsarskoye Selo to debate Tsarist succession law in the wake of the Trotskyist Uprising, which saw the deaths of much of the Romanov family. The consensus was that in the event of a Tsarist restoration within Russia, any family member who was fit to rule, who desired to return, could do so, to re-establish the Romanov dynasty in the wake of the mass exodus of the rest of the family from the country."

 russia_fl.8.d:0 "Having noticed the interest in democracy that seems to be rising in Russia, the United Kingdom sent a group of envoys to the Russian Duma to meet with various politicians and share their input for how best to transition Russia into a democratic country.

He was discovered dead in his office after a late night of hard work. Crowds have gathered to mourn the passing of the General, and a state funeral is being planned.

Though Moscow is the capital of Russia for security reasons, Petrograd was chosen for its historical significance to Russia's Tsarist past. The event has brought an attendance of hundreds of thousands, including foreign dignitaries from across Europe and beyond- with the notable exception of France, currently facing intense internal strife. \n\n Concurrent with the coronation will be a series of elections, in which Russia's civil government will be decided- the polling heavily favors conservative candidate Alexei Khvostov, who has tacitly backed the restoration of the Romanov throne, whereas his opponent Viktor Chernov has opposed it." #constitutionalist, mention elections

 #descriptions
 RUS_power_struggle_desc:0 "With Kornilov on his deathbed, numerous factions are vying for control of the nation. Russia is at a crossroads; it must be guided."
 RUS_democratic_desc:0 "The future of Russia is liberty for its citizens. The path to democracy starts now."
 RUS_kolchak_desc:0 "With the death of Kornilov, the time has come for his most adept subordinate to take the reins. Admiral Kolchak will be ready to assume leadership of the Russian State."
 RUS_tsar_desc:0 "Russia as a nation must return to its imperial glory. This must start with the reinstallment of a surviving and willing Romanov."
 RUS_elections_desc:0 "The Presidential elections are upon us! The Russian people will soon vote a proper Head of State into power."
 RUS_chernov_desc:0 "Viktor Chernov has won the election!"
 RUS_khvostov_desc:0 "Alexei Khvostov has won the election!"
 RUS_suffrage_desc:0 "The women of this nation deserve to have full suffrage. It is the hallmark of a proper democratic society."
 RUS_workers_rights_desc:0 "The rights of the worker are paramount in the construction of a nation. They must be honored in order to maintain a strong, unified, and productive nation."
 RUS_healthcare_desc:0 "Healthcare for all will improve the quality of life for our citizenry, and increase average lifespans, improving the long-term productivity of our nation."
 RUS_free_press_desc:0 "The freedom of press is another important right that Russia has traditionally lacked. Codifying laws and rights to defend this precept is important to safeguard our fledgling democracy."
 RUS_infrastructure_desc:0 "A railway linking our largest city and a major industrial center will help our industries export their goods abroad."
 RUS_telecom_desc:0 "Investing in our telecommunications companies will help better connect our nation as a whole and improve the coordination of civilian and military undertakings."
 RUS_transpolar_desc:0 "Organizing transpolar flights will better link the west and east of our nation, and provide insight into the research of newer and more powerful aircraft engines."
 RUS_suspend_duma_desc:0 "For some time already the Duma has been merely a show- bread and circus for the citizenry. It is unnecessary to the governance of Russia."
 RUS_okhrana_desc:0 "Stabilizing the nation will require an iron fist. Expanding the existing Okhrana will be vital in our effort."
 RUS_stop_protests_desc:0 "The ongoing protests in the streets against the new leader are inexcusable and cannot be allowed to continue if we are to keep the nation unified."
 RUS_censorship_desc:0 "Increasing press censorship will ensure that the citizenry hears the news we want them to hear- this will help unify us and prevent destructive infiltrators from gaining a voice."
 RUS_army_with_state_desc:0 "Russia under Kolchak's rule has transformed into something resembling a stratocracy. This is not a bad thing- this could, in fact, be one of the most efficient forms of government devised."
 RUS_empire_bez_tsar_desc:0 "It is time for us to embrace a new form of our imperial past- we were once a great power and we will be a great power once more."
 RUS_constitutionalism_desc:0 "A constitutionalist form of monarchy, resembling the British institution, will properly balance the need for a monarch to unify the nation and a democratic government to run the nation"
 RUS_absolutism_desc:0 "An absolutist form of monarchy is truly the Russian way. Only through complete Tsarist control can we rebuild our former glory from which we fell."
 RUS_third_nikolai_desc:0 "Tsarina Anastasia will go down as a historic monarch, the first of a new line after the 20 years of turmoil in Russia. She must take this time to build a positive image for all Russians."
 RUS_reform_judiciary_desc:0 "The judiciary has grown corrupt during the Kornilov era, and has so far been left untouched during the transitional process. Reforming it will ensure a fairer Tsardom for the subjects of the Tsarina to live under."
 RUS_peoples_tsar_desc:0 "An image of the Tsarina being a charitable leader will help further unify the nation by earning the trust and support of the lower classes of Russian society."
 RUS_dismantle_duma_desc:0 "The Duma was always an absurd concept, that noblemen or even commoners could or should excerise the authority that belongs to the monarch. This power must be re-vested in the Tsarina alone."
 RUS_aristocracy_desc:0 "A military aristocracy will serve as the new noblemen in the new age of Russia."
 RUS_imperial_propaganda_desc:0 "Pro-Imperial propaganda must be disseminated among the people of Russia to instill loyalty in the Tsarina."
 RUS_modernity_desc:0 "Though we have reached back to our roots, we cannot fall behind the march of time and the world that follows suit. Our revitalized society must continue to advance forward."
 RUS_grand_purge_desc:0 "In the 20 years without rule by the Royal family, the nation has become riddled with anti-monarchist views and proponents. Most obnoxiously- the Neo-Marxist advocates. The Tsarina demands bloodshed in return for the death of her family- and her demands reign supreme."
 RUS_exceptionalism_desc:0 "Russia is a unique nation, and our people are uniquely geared to push our nation to the limits and overcome obstacles that would cripple any other country."
 RUS_new_imperialism_desc:0 "With Russia secure under monarchist rule, we must stand ready to march outward at the Tsarina's command."
 RUS_kolchak_reforms_desc:0 "Kolchak's reforms will transform Russian society into the military state most fitting for it."
 RUS_chernov_reforms_desc:0 "Chernov's reforms will transform Russian society to benefit the common man as Russia rises from the ashes of the Great War."
 RUS_khvostov_reforms_desc:0 "Khvostov's reforms will transform Russian society to fast-track it into the modern era where it belongs."
 RUS_tsar_reforms_desc:0 "The Tsarina's reforms will transform Russian society to reinvigorate the Orthodox lifeblood of the Russian people."
 RUS_kolchak_youth_desc:0 "The Kolchak Youth is a proposed organization for young men that will raise them to survive in harsh conditions and fight in the army or alone."
 RUS_militancy_desc:0 "A militarized society ready to fight Russia's enemies is essential. Kornilov did not pursue this goal far enough- Kolchak will."
 RUS_samo_desc:0 "Russia is a vast nation with the resources to sustain itself indefinitely. Shifting Russia to be as self-sufficient as possible is important to restore our preeminence in the world."
 RUS_unify_desc:0 "The unity of Russia under the new regime is paramount to our future success."
 RUS_expand_duma_desc:0 "The Duma is ill-equipped to serve the entirety of the Russian nation in its current state. Funds must be allocated to expand the Duma building, elect more representatives, and increase the Duma's powers."
 RUS_tax_kulak_desc:0 "The kulaks have served faithfully as a tool of the government to keep the common man suppressed. No longer!"
 RUS_amnesty_desc:0 "The Bolsheviks do not have the Marxist state they necessarily envision, but most of their concerns have been indirectly satisfied. Granting them amnesty will allow them to reintegrate into society and serve it faithfully."
 RUS_restore_trust_desc:0 "The concerns of the Bolsheviks of old have been eased, but the rest of the public is wary of the new changes. We will show them through good deeds that the new order is one to be trusted, for it has their direct needs and desires in mind."
 RUS_subsidize_industry_desc:0 "Industrial might is key to the restoration of Russian power. We must subsidize the growth of Russia's various industries."
 RUS_agriculture_desc:0 "The farmers of Russia rely on obsolete, inefficient methods of farming. Subsidizing them and giving them modern farming equipment will allow them to farm more efficiently."
 RUS_nationalize_banks_desc:0 "Russia's banks are not owned by Russians, but by foreign nationals. We must strip these international bankers of the wealth they hoard and reinvest it in the Russian people."
 RUS_reenter_world_stage_desc:0 "With Russia on the path to recovery, it is time we reassert our place in world affairs."
 RUS_middle_class_desc:0 "Monarchy or not, the world is modernizing. Russia must keep up by encouraging the growth of the middle class."
 RUS_orthodox_morale_desc:0 "Russia is, at its heart, an Orthodox nation. We must encourage the reinvigoration of faith in Christ the Savior, and the Church which wrought us our nation."
 RUS_cooperate_kulak_desc:0 "The Kulaks are the lifeblood of Russia's agricultural industry- the success of their farms and businesses defines the success of the nation. We must support them in their endeavors to expand and increase productivity."
 RUS_royal_enlightenment_desc:0 "Through numerous poorly-trained and poorly-raised Tsars, the people had developed a negative view of the Tsarist institution as a whole. The reforms of Anastasia should reverse that image- to bring glory and weight to the title of the Tsar- or Tsarina- once again."
 RUS_military_reform_desc:0 "The world continues to develop its weapons and tactics. We must continue to innovate our military, so that a calamity like our defeat in the Great War does not reoccur."
 RUS_land_doctrine_desc:0 "Land doctrines are changing as the years pass. We must ensure our battle tactics are developed enough to lend us victory on the battlefield."
 RUS_sea_doctrine_desc:0 "Russia's sea access is limited, which only multiplies the importance of defending Russian waters. Naval doctrine is key to doing so."
 RUS_air_doctrine_desc:0 "The skies are not excluded from the battlefield nowadays- in fact, the controller of the skies can determine the controller of the other two theaters. We must ensure we control our vast skies."
 RUS_withdraw_pact_desc:0 "The London Naval Treaty is a worthless slip of paper that asserts it has authority over the actions of our navy and shipyards. We do not need it."
 RUS_dockyards_desc:0 "Expanding Russian shipbuilding facilities will allow us to reinforce our navies when it is most critical."
 RUS_submarines_desc:0 "The Black and Baltic Seas are killing fields for enemy ships if we have the submarines to kill them. We must focus on their development in order to counter "
 RUS_marines_desc:0 "Training Naval Infantry will gives us an edge in combat in the various seas surrounding Russia, striking into enemy territory where least expected."
 RUS_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery is the deciding factor of any conflict. We must ensure that we update and modernize our artillery forces, to keep in line with the Russian artillery doctrine."
 RUS_mechanized_desc:0 "High-mobility Mechanized Infantry is the future for Russian warfare, where we will fight across the vast plains of Europe and Central Asia."
 RUS_tanks_desc:0 "The T-34 is a proposed cost-effective medium tank that will outclass all others in its class, and potentially even the light and heavy tanks as well. This piece of hardware could give us a major advantage on the battlefield."
 RUS_engineer_desc:0 "The Russian Support Battalions are critical to the proper upkeep and continued fighting effectiveness of the Russian Army across the vast plains and steppes of Russia."
 RUS_intel_desc:0 "Pioneering new forms of military intelligence will further help us command the battlefield when war arrives at our doorstep."
 RUS_special_desc:0 "Specialized Infantry will succeed where regular infantry falter on the diverse battlefields across our nation and Europe."
 RUS_modernize_military_desc:0 "Keeping the military modernized is a constant, unending task. We must continue to advance our capabilities, as the enemy will most certainly be doing the same."
 RUS_fighters_desc:0 "Investing in fighter aircraft and pilots will neutralize the threat of enemy air dominance in our own country."
 RUS_bombers_desc:0 "Tactical Bombers will be able to strike large enemy formations and disorient them, harming the enemy war effort and relieving stress from our ground forces."
 RUS_cas_desc:0 "Shturmovik aircraft are armored planes specializing in close air support, performing lightning strikes on enemy positions at critical moments where most needed by strained ground forces."
 RUS_rocket_desc:0 "Rocketry research will allow us to push the envelope on the advancement of air power and weaponry."
 RUS_nuke_desc:0 "Atomic scientists are working to create an extremely powerful munition, whose power will be comparable to the mysterious Tunguska explosion that occured decades ago."
 RUS_healing_our_scars_desc:0 "The conclusion of the Great War has severely scarred our nation and caused a rift in society. We must restore hope in the Russian people and sew the rift."
 RUS_tsaritsyn_desc:0 "Economic buildup in Tsaritsyn will heal one of the worst-affected areas of the war."
 RUS_volga_expand_desc:0 "Expanding the Tsaritsyn industries will further improve the region, and brign economic revitalization to the entire Lower Volga region."
 RUS_petrograd_desc:0 "Economic buildup in Petrograd will build up wealth significantly, in order to generate funds to be reinvested elsewhere."
 RUS_baltic_expand_desc:0 "Continuing the expansion throughout the newly-acquited Baltic territories will further pull our country our of depression."
 RUS_finn_border_desc:0 "The Finns, in the chaos of the war, seized the entirety of Karelia and Kola. Until we are ready to retake our lost territories, we must keep the region fortified, particularly vulnerable Petrograd."
 RUS_kavkaz_border_desc:0 "The Caucasian nation, a product of the Brest-Litovsk treaty, will soon be dissolved to rejoin Russia once more, when they are liberated from Jugashvili's government. Until then, we must remain fortified against any potential Caucasian incursion into the destitute Tsaritsyn region."
 RUS_uni_desc:0 "Funding the universities in Petrograd, Moscow and elsewhere will create a new generation of economists, scientists, and engineers, ready to serve their nation."
 RUS_research_desc:0 "Funding the research into more efficient industrial practices will fast-track our economic and spiritual recovery."
 RUS_recovery_desc:0 "Russian society has been nursed back to health. It is time for it to stand strong."

 RUS_northern_diplom_desc:0 "The Baltic Union was wrested from us in 1918, while Finland split Russian territory from Russia when forming its state. All of the territory surrounding Petrograd must be secured."
 RUS_central_asia_diplom_desc:0 "Our presence in Central asia allowed us to control much of the trade from China to the West. Reoccupying those territories is critical."
 RUS_attack_turk_desc:0 "Turkey played an important role in securing the downfall of our nation, and, in recovering from its own humiliation, seeks to reclaim its own territory once more. We cannot allow the threat to continue to develop."
 RUS_farther_east_desc:0 "Our eastern holdings were wrested from us in the Treaty of Sinaloa. It is time to undo the other Undignified Treaty and reclaim our premier Pacific port."
 RUS_russosphere_desc:0 "Russia stands alone in the world- such is the natural order. But should other nations fall into our sphere of influence, we must be ready to lead them."
 RUS_approch_britain_desc:0 "The British, despite aiding Japan in 1905, aided us in the Great War to the best of their ability. They are still the preeminent world power, and we should seek to align ourselves with them."
 RUS_approach_france_desc:0 "The French, establishing a new socialist government, are signalling a shift in the world order. They need our help to regain their power, but in time they will help us as well."
 RUS_approach_austria_desc:0 "The Austrians, eager to reclaim their lost glory, are moving against our age-old foes in a fury of revanchism. They stand against the socialist tide as we do. It is in our best interests to put aside our anger towards them to face a common enemy."
 RUS_polish_deal_desc:0 "We need to continue to expand our influence westward, and the British need another ally against the Austrian menace. Their allowing us to retake Poland for ourselves will better position us to help aid them."
