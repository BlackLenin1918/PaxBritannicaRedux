French.1.t:0 "Victory in Frankfurt"
French.1.d:0 "With the German menace finally pushed back to its capital, French forces were able to swiftly capture the administrative capital of the German Empire. With the fall of Frankfurt, led by the chaos and division plagueing the Germans, several German officials and commanders have proposed negotiations regarding peace and ending our German war effort. With the British still on our tail, a German peace could allow us to focus our attention on the decadent British Empire. The new pro-French government has been established in Munich under the German nationalist Anton Drexler and a group of other French collaborators that are willing to fight against the British empire and liberal democracy."
French.1.a:0 "Victory at last"
French.2.t:0 "Appointing a German Commissaire"
French.2.d:0 "With the establishment of the Nuremberg Protectorate in the former Habsburg lands of Germany, a new question arises on the issue of German leadership. The current head of state, Anton Drexler, was the man to lead the peace treaty between the German collaborators and the French army. However, Drexler, like all German nationalist, is completely insane, corrupted by dark Germanic spells of romantic nationalism and pagan mythology. Many among our German occupation staff even belief that Drexler is the anti-christ himself. Thus, some have started to vouch for a new German head of state to replace Drexler. Several options have become staff favorites, but there has yet to be an official discussion about this change in management."
French.2.a:0 "Drexler is not the anti-christ, Monsieur..."
French.2.b:0 "Wilhelm Kube can direct German collaboration"
French.2.c:0 "Freikorps opposition Walter Stennes can keep Drexler in check"
French.2.e:0 "Appoint our loyal Maurice Gamelin"
French.3.t:0 "Anti-French Partisan Movement"
French.3.d:0 "The recent defeat of the German army and the following peace between the Nuremberg government and France hasn't been popular among most German citizens. Many blame the German nationalists for their loyalty to France, starting the 'stab-in-the-back' myth among most urban citizens. Now, several groups of socialists, liberals and even other nationalists have formed an disunited partisan movement across Germany as to keep the collaboration government from helping the French war effort. These partisan movements have already begun to become a major problem for the collaboration government and many fear all-out revolt if anything bad would ever happen to the French war effort."
French.3.a:0 "Okay"
French.4.t:0 "Formation of an Army"
French.4.d:0 "While the Peace of Nürnberg did disband the standing army, France has recently send us a telegram regarding the status of is in the war. France expects us to support the war effort against Britain and has thus granted us the privilige of a defensive and offensive force, while restricting us regarding the navy and the airforce for now."
French.4.a:0 "Thanks"
French.5.t:0 "Peace signed"
French.5.d:0 "After hours of debate and threats, German diplomat and foreign minister Joachim Ribbentrop gets out of the conference room with a dissapointed look on his face. The news is quickly brought to the government in Nuremberg, detailing the effects of the new treaty regarding the army and the economy. Germany will not be able to field an army for a hundred year period and Germany will pay France 20% of its economic capacity to repay for the damage done."
French.5.a:0 "Peace without a bit of honour"

  # IDEAS
  ##########################
  PB_FRA_Crumbling_Coalition:0 "The Crumbling Coalition"
  PB_FRA_Crumbling_Coalition_desc:0 "The Republic's government is currently dominated by a triumverate between three major power blocs. Jacques Doriot's Ultranationalist faction, Charles Maurras' Restorationists, and the People's Unitary Front lead by Inessa Armand. While previously these factions cooperated to keep power away from more moderate voices, their recent political dominance has turned their ambitions against each other. The triumverate is rapidly degrading as the three leaders prepare to take down the others and claim the future of the French state for themselves."
  PB_FRA_Bitter_Revanchism:0 "Bitter Revanchism"
  PB_FRA_Bitter_Revanchism_desc:0 "France’s defeat in the Great War has created an angry, bitter populace, open to ultra-nationalist ideals of revanchism. Anti-German sentiment has only grown since the armistice, pushing France once more down the path of war."
  PB_FRA_Public_Security:0 "Sécurité publique"
  PB_FRA_Public_Security_desc:0 "The SP, or Public Security, is the nationalist paramilitary arm of the French Popular Party. Armed and dangerous, they have worked to suppress any other political parties throughout the Republic. Anti-semitic, anti-German and anti-English purges are frequent."
  PB_FRA_Military_SP_Rivalry_Balanced:0 "Military-SP Rivalry Balanced"
  PB_FRA_Military_SP_Rivalry_Balanced_desc:0 " The Military of the Republic and the paramilitary SP have an ongoing rivalry for influence over the government. Both factions seek to curtail the influence of the other to ultimately gain political supremacy. The militarists wish to see resources provided to the SP cut, with many in the upper echelons of the army seeing the SP as little more than thugs. The SP, on the other hand, seeks to increase their political authority and raw military power. Favoring one faction too much over the other could have dangerous political consequences for the government.\n\nThe rivalry is currently §Ybalanced§!."
 PB_MGE_German_Volunteers:0 "Charlemagne Volunteer Divisions"
 PB_MGE_German_Volunteers_desc:0 "By only allowing those who belief in the true goals of neo-imperialism to fight in this war, we will guarantee a more equal fighting spirit to the French army. However, this will cut down the possible manpower we can draw upon and threaten our sovereignty as nation even more."
