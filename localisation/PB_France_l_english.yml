  PB_FRA_Crumbling_Coalition:0 "The Crumbling Coalition"
  PB_FRA_Crumbling_Coalition_desc:0 "The Republic's government is currently dominated by a triumverate between three major power blocs. Jacques Doriot's Ultranationalist faction, Charles Maurras' Restorationists, and the People's Unitary Front lead by Inessa Armand. While previously these factions cooperated to keep power away from more moderate voices, their recent political dominance has turned their ambitions against each other. The triumverate is rapidly degrading as the three leaders prepare to take down the others and claim the future of the French state for themselves."
  PB_FRA_Bitter_Revanchism:0 "Bitter Revanchism"
  PB_FRA_Bitter_Revanchism_desc:0 "France’s defeat in the Great War has created an angry, bitter populace, open to ultra-nationalist ideals of revanchism. Anti-German sentiment has only grown since the armistice, pushing France once more down the path of war."
  PB_FRA_Public_Security:0 "Sécurité publique"
  PB_FRA_Public_Security_desc:0 "The SP, or Public Security, is the nationalist paramilitary arm of the French Popular Party. Armed and dangerous, they have worked to suppress any other political parties throughout the Republic. Anti-semitic, anti-German and anti-English purges are frequent."
  PB_FRA_Military_SP_Rivalry_Balanced:0 "Military-SP Rivalry Balanced"
  PB_FRA_Military_SP_Rivalry_Balanced_desc:0 " The Military of the Republic and the paramilitary SP have an ongoing rivalry for influence over the government. Both factions seek to curtail the influence of the other to ultimately gain political supremacy. The militarists wish to see resources provided to the SP cut, with many in the upper echelons of the army seeing the SP as little more than thugs. The SP, on the other hand, seeks to increase their political authority and raw military power. Favoring one faction too much over the other could have dangerous political consequences for the government.\n\nThe rivalry is currently §Ybalanced§!."
