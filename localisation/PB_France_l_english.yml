  French.1.t:0 "Victory in Frankfurt"
  French.1.d:0 "With the German menace finally pushed back to its capital, French forces were able to swiftly capture the administrative capital of the German Empire. With the fall of Frankfurt, led by the chaos and division plagueing the Germans, several German officials and commanders have proposed negotiations regarding peace and ending our German war effort. With the British still on our tail, a German peace could allow us to focus our attention on the decadent British Empire. The new pro-French government has been established in Munich under the German nationalist Anton Drexler and a group of other French collaborators that are willing to fight against the British empire and liberal democracy."
  French.1.a:0 "Victory at last"

  French.2.t:0 "Appointing a German Commissaire"
  French.2.d:0 "With the establishment of the Nuremberg Protectorate in the former Habsburg lands of Germany, a new question arises on the issue of German leadership. The current head of state, Anton Drexler, was the man to lead the peace treaty between the German collaborators and the French army. However, Drexler, like all German nationalist, is completely insane, corrupted by dark Germanic spells of romantic nationalism and pagan mythology. Many among our German occupation staff even belief that Drexler is the anti-christ himself. Thus, some have started to vouch for a new German head of state to replace Drexler. Several options have become staff favorites, but there has yet to be an official discussion about this change in management."
  French.2.a:0 "Drexler is not the anti-christ, Monsieur..."
  French.2.b:0 "Wilhelm Kube can direct German collaboration"
  French.2.c:0 "Freikorps opposition Walter Stennes can keep Drexler in check"
  French.2.e:0 "Appoint our loyal Maurice Gamelin"

  French.3.t:0 "Anti-French Partisan Movement"
  French.3.d:0 "The recent defeat of the German army and the following peace between the Nuremberg government and France hasn't been popular among most German citizens. Many blame the German nationalists for their loyalty to France, starting the 'stab-in-the-back' myth among most urban citizens. Now, several groups of socialists, liberals and even other nationalists have formed an disunited partisan movement across Germany as to keep the collaboration government from helping the French war effort. These partisan movements have already begun to become a major problem for the collaboration government and many fear all-out revolt if anything bad would ever happen to the French war effort."
  French.3.a:0 "Okay"

  French.4.t:0 "Formation of an Army"
  French.4.d:0 "While the Peace of Nürnberg did disband the standing army, France has recently send us a telegram regarding the status of is in the war. France expects us to support the war effort against Britain and has thus granted us the privilige of a defensive and offensive force, while restricting us regarding the navy and the airforce for now."
  French.4.a:0 "Thanks"

  French.5.t:0 "Peace signed"
  French.5.d:0 "After hours of debate and threats, German diplomat and foreign minister Joachim Ribbentrop gets out of the conference room with a dissapointed look on his face. The news is quickly brought to the government in Nuremberg, detailing the effects of the new treaty regarding the army and the economy. Germany will not be able to field an army for a hundred year period and Germany will pay France 20% of its economic capacity to repay for the damage done."
  French.5.a:0 "Peace without a bit of honour"

  French.6.t:0 "Whispers in the Halls of Paris"
  French.6.d:0 "Since the ascension of the triumvirate, there has been significant political tension between the various factions. Over the last few weeks, concerns have been raised among the monarchist and left-nationalist factions of the government that Doriot's ultranationalists may be plotting a coup.\n\nThough these are only rumors at the moment, there is the legitimate threat that the SP under the pro-ultranationast Darnand may attempt to leverage their considerable authority to back Doriot's plans.

  French.9.t:0 "Duck confit, with a dash of Violence"
  French.9.d:0 "As night falls over Paris, members of Charles Maurras' Action Française party assemble for their annual party meeting in a Paris dining hall. Though there have been fears of potential violence at the hands of the pro-Doriot militias, little has seemingly happened over the past weeks to change Maurras' plans. The focus of this evening's meeting is the prospect of aligning with the Armandist faction of the FPF in order to unseat Doriot. Though Armand holds little love for the former monarchy, Maurras has promised reforms and concessions to the left-nationalists in exchange for their support.\n\nA final concern before the meeting begins is the issue of security. Given the incessant mood of paranoia that has fallen over Paris, it seems only natural to provide some degree of security to the attendees. Alternatively, as a means to strengthen the alliance with the left-nationals, they could be armed to provide security for the event."
  French.9.a:0 "Rely on the local authorities during the Dinner"
  French.9.b:0 "Secretly funnel arms to the monarchists"

  French.14.a:0 "Stability must be bought in blood."

  French.15.t:0 "The Cultural Reconstruction - Edict on Degenerate Art"
  French.15.d:0 "The grand cultural reconstruction has begun. Speaking before an assembled crowd at the Louvre, Grand Marshal Doriot announced the beginning of the \"Cultural Reconstruction\" of the French State. The Marshal declared that all forms of so-called \"degenerate\" art were to be destroyed for a wave of new French artistic expression, guided by the FPF. The Louvre, he declared, would be just the beginning of this new rebuilding of traditional French culture, free from the decadence and immorality of the Bourbons.\n\nFollowing this announcement, SP militants have begun ransacking museums and art galleries throughout Paris and the country, either destroying or looting a countless number of priceless works. In the Louvre alone, much of the Republican-era modern art has been destroyed, though many of the museuem's most important pieces were quietly evacuated before the SP could invade. Most notably, Da Vinci's Mona Lisa was reported stolen and taken to Italy by \"traitorous Maurras sympathizers\".\n\nFrance, once a cultural capital of the world, has had its' heart sliced out by the new regime. The skies around Paris blacken with the ash of thousands of burnt canvases."
  French.15.a:0 "A small cost for the future"

  French.16.t:0 "The Cultural Reconstruction - Edict on the Past"
  French.16.d:0 "Yet again, the Grand Marshal addresses the nation. The next edict of the cultural reconstruction is to target France's past, more specifically, its' Bourbon heritage. Doriot, in an effort to further cement the absolute power of the state, has ordered the mass demolition of any buildings or monuments erected by the former Bourbon monarchy.\n\n\"The weakness of the former Emperors shall not be that of the New France\", he stated to an assembled crowd in Paris. Not only this, but the former nobility of the French state, or at least those that have not already fled, are to be killed or detained. Over a hundred former civil servants, nobles, and pro-Bourbon business owners have been detained and have seemingly vanished, likely killed by the SP or the increasingly militant Doriot Youth clubs that have popped up throughout the nation."
  French.16.a:0 "The World will never know they existed."

  French.17.t:0 "The Cultural Reconstruction - Edict on the Future"
  French.17.d:0 "As the Cultural Reconstruction reaches a fever pitch, the Grand Marshal has made his last edict on the matter, detailing his manifesto for the future of France. His plan is ambitious to say the least, and equally disquieting for those he has declared his regime against. A series of laws are to be implemented officially banning anyone of German heritage from public office or business ownership. Laws against France's not insignifcant Jewish population have been enacted, with the Doriot regime declaring them as \"racial fifth columnists\" to the French people.\n\nCoupled with these new racial laws is a \"generation plan\" proposed by the regime intended to dramatically increase France's birth rate over the course of the next decade. The Generation Plan is intended to create an \"ethnically pure\" France with a population to outgrow Europe's German diaspora.\n\nAlready, thousands of German, Jewish, and other minority groups have begun a mass exodus from France. Across the nation, German border communities and synagogues burn as the SP begins to enact the Grand Marshal's will."
  French.17.a:0 "Tomorrow belongs to us."

  French.18.t:0 "The Cultural Reconstruction - Edict on the Church"
  French.18.d:0 "Yet another victim of the Cultural Reconstruction has been France's majority religion, Catholicism. While the Doriotist faction of the FPF had previously maintained neutrality on religious affairs, this was a compromise of convenience rather than ideology. Citing the pro-Catholic policies of the now purged Maurras faction, the FPF has set off a wave of violence throughout France against the Catholic Church in France in an effort to violently secularize the country\n\nSpeaking over the radio on the issue, the Grand Marshal declared \"the authority of the clergy, entrenched by the weak monarchy, is a danger to the moral fortitude of the new French people.\" This phase of the Reconstruction has proven the most divisive to the French people, a plurality of which are Catholic or at least Christian. Significant resistance has come from the countryside and many townships are under assault by the SP for their refusal to accept the new forced secularization. In the place of religion, the Doriot regime has begun to push a new doctrine of \"National Worship\", effectively attempting to craft their own new religion out of reverence for the state and the French people. Condemnations have naturally been issued by both Naples and Frankfurt, with both governments offering to open their borders to religious refugees."
  French.18.a:0 "The Church shall be swept away, as with all things against the New State."

  PB_FRA_Interservice_Rivalry_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral areas of France's government are dominated by two major factions, the Military and the Sécurité publique. The Militarists, naturally, represent the interests of the French Armed Forces, particularly the Army and Navy. Opposing the Militarists is the Sécurité publique, the paramilitary arm of the French Popular Party. These two factions harbor a deep distrust of one another, with the Militarists seeing the SP as too fanatical and the SP seeing the military as ideological fifth columnists.\n\nBoth factions wish to see their influence dominant the French government, however if either faction gains too much political power, it could lead to §Rdramatic consequences§! for the current ruling party. Despite this, shifting power to either faction can grant bonuses to the military or the political scene, while keeping them balanced will only provide very small gains. We must carefully consider which faction we wish to empower, if any.\n\n[get_rivalry_balance]\n\n[get_SP_leader]\n\n[get_militarist_leader]\n"
