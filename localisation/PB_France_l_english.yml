  PB_FRA_Crumbling_Coalition:0 "The Crumbling Coalition"
  PB_FRA_Crumbling_Coalition_desc:0 "The Republic's government is currently dominated by a triumverate between three major power blocs. Jacques Doriot's Ultranationalist faction, Charles Maurras' Restorationists, and the People's Unitary Front lead by Inessa Armand. While previously these factions cooperated to keep power away from more moderate voices, their recent political dominance has turned their ambitions against each other. The triumverate is rapidly degrading as the three leaders prepare to take down the others and claim the future of the French state for themselves."
  PB_FRA_Bitter_Revanchism:0 "Bitter Revanchism"
  PB_FRA_Bitter_Revanchism_desc:0 "France’s defeat in the Great War has created an angry, bitter populace, open to ultra-nationalist ideals of revanchism. Anti-German sentiment has only grown since the armistice, pushing France once more down the path of war."
  PB_FRA_Public_Security:0 "Sécurité publique"
  PB_FRA_Public_Security_desc:0 "The SP, or Public Security, is the nationalist paramilitary arm of the French Popular Party. Armed and dangerous, they have worked to suppress any other political parties throughout the Republic. Anti-semitic, anti-German and anti-English purges are frequent."
