  PB_Jacques_Doriot_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 26/9/1898\n\n§YJacques Doriot§! is something of an enigma in French politics. Born to a working class family in Saint Denis, near Paris. At an early age, Doriot was exposed to the revolutionary politics of wartime France. Far too young to join the military at the onset of the Great War, Doriot could only watch from the sidelines as France began to shudder and break under the strain of war. As supplies dwindled daily and the sounds of gunfire approached Paris, Doriot's family fled to Orléans, where they would remain until the end of the conflict.\n\nThe collapse of the French Empire and the imposition of a Republic would catapult the nation into a period of intense unrest. Revolutionaries, restorationists and common thugs battled in the streets over what was left of the French corpse. It was in this pressure cooker political scene that Doriot would begin his rise to power. Initially a member of the Socialist Youth League, he abandoned left wing politics after the failed September Paris Uprising in 1926. Instead, he aligned himself with the newly formed French Popular Front and Marcel Déat, and by 1928 the FPF had taken the reigns of the Republic in a coalition with the pro-monarchist Action Française. Déat died suddenly in 1929 and the subsequent power struggle ended with Doriot seizing control of the party, though at the cost of major concessions to the AF and the Left-Nationalists. Now the de-facto dictator of France, Jacques Doriot seeks revenge against the Germans and the re-establishment of France's dominance in Europe. The French population, radicalized by Long Depression and the Treaty of Tours, stand united, at least on paper, with the Grand Marshal's vision of a new imperial France.\n\n§RAcross the border lies the enemy of the French people, and it is the holy duty of the Grand Marshal to exorcise this degenerate Judeo-Germanic curse from Europe, no matter the cost!§!"

  PB_Charles_Muarras_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 20/4/1868\n\n§YCharles Maurras§! is considered by some as France's most loyal patriot, and by others as a crooked old fool that believes in bygone traditions. Whatever the case may be one thing for sure is Maurras and his cronies remain adamant on the return of the Bourbon dynasty, which has remained in exile in Corsica since the Great War. Before the Great War Maurras was a self-employed author mainly writing non-fiction books on political science, taking inspiration from various pre-20th century philosophies, namely Existentialism and Phenomenology.\n\nMaurras lived a rather poor life finding only minor success in a few written texts but by the end of the Great War this difficulty only became worse. Food stalls became a permanent fixture of Maurras' life until a small pro-monarchist printing agency hired him. From there Maurras rose through the ranks and established himself as a fairly notable writer, ultimately becoming head of the New Kings League newspaper company.\n\nBy 1927 the political landscape of France was by all definitions an utter shit show. Strikes and protests occurred almost daily and from this point on Maurras started to present himself as the man with all the solutions, gathering public support and finding a 'comfortable' position in the newly founded Front Populaire Français. Today Charles Maurras stands victorious in the triumvirate and though stability is finally restored, to some degree, reconstruction and preperation for Europe's 'darkest years' is required if France is to outlive the storm.\n\n§RAll heil Maurras!§!"

  PB_Inessa_Armand_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 8/5/1874\n\n§YInessa Armand§! can only be described as both revolutionary and counter-revolutionary. She developed Armandism - a form of social nationalism - by borrowing elements from different political extremes and combining them into one heterogenous belief. Armand gained much renown and support between middle-lower class individuals during the unruly years of 1926-1928, participating in numerous strikes and boycotts. While not exactly Jacobin Armand does contain a certain distrust of those on top, hence her clique being the weakest of the triumvirate.\n\nPrior and during the Great War Armand served as an auxiliary nurse, seeing first hand the effects and brutalities of conflict unlike the other triumvirate members. Even when the war was over peace had not fallen upon France. The years following, especially those before 1929, were ravaged with social and political strife; something that worked greatly in favour for Armand. By the time the Front Populaire Français was established Inessa Armand was already a well known name amongst the French people. With her political rivals now dead, Armand can now fully realize her perfect France.\n\n§RGod bless our Jeanne, and our liberated France!§!"

  PB_Charles_Nogues_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 13/8/1876\n\n§YCharles Noguès§! was born into wealth. He was raised in a family owned estate in north-east Morocco for much of his childhood. Every week a new shipment of eager French colonists would arrive through the Spanish city of Melilla, here Mr. Noguès saw the rapid Francization of Africa along with all the new technologies the mainland could offer. Some called it civilization, others called it imperialism. Ironically by his late teens Mr. Noguès would take the very route many followed just to arrive to the place he called home for so long, he would establish himself in Paris and join the École Polytechnique and pursue military doctrinal studies before his entry into the army.\n\nWhen the Great War broke out Mr. Noguès specialized in armoured warfare and was an early proponent of landship utilization, spearheading France's first Armoured Corp at the battle of Verdun; the results were simply to good to ignore. Even when the Treaty of Tours was signed secret efforts were being made to reverse engineer captured mechs, although the technology had be used against its creators general production knowledge was still unknown. "

  PB_Claire_Chennault_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 6/9/1893\n\n§YClaire Chennault§!, nicknamed Old Leatherface, is an Franco-American by birth. Originating from Louisana he took an early interest in politics, subsequently joining the Commonwealth army at the age of 18. Being far too young to apply for Operation Overlord during the Great War he instead watched from the sidelines as brothers and fathers quickly applied for the so-called 'war to end all wars'.\n\nHe finally saw reputable service in Wallonia where he was stationed on the border with France, belonging to a joint Anglo-American expeditionary force. Around the late 20s the economic situation of Wallonia was looking quite depressing and with Britain refusing troops passage back to America because of the situation with France many Americans defected across the border. Only to be welcomed by an authoritarian government in need of experienced and disciplined soliders. In fact thousands of American defectors quickly found positions in law enforcement because of their non-French identity, the state believed that these foreigners would be more harsh then the typical French man and would lack any restraint in their duties."

  PB_Maxime_Weygand_DESC:0 ""

  PB_Maurice_Gamelin_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 20/9/1872\n\n§YMaurice Gamelin§! is France's greatest tactician. Being born in a rural town just outside of central Paris exposed Mr. Gamelin to a mixed life of odd-urban jobs and the occasional summer wheat field retreat, though times have changed. The France he once saw burn has risen once again, ready to toy with her weak prey and establish herself as Europe's greatest empire.\n\nWhen the German's came knocking on Paris' door Petain and his hastly cobbled defence force did little in preventing the fall of the French capital; Gamelin and the rest of the officer corp as a result retreated to Tours with a small contingency force being sent to Orleans. Here his skills truly shined, even though France had entered her dying hour enough time had passed for Gamelin to be promoted to lieutenant. The small operational force he operated under (which amounted to nothing greater than 4000 men) captured a vital supply line that cost the Germans and British a great deal in their campaigns, managing to hold out under continous siege till the wars end. As France enters a new age Gamelin, and many others just like him, must help France pave her way to greatest; else she shall once again fall."

  PB_Louis_Franchet_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 25/5/1856\n\n§YLouis Franchet§! has seen the world change drastically, traditions have been replaced with steel and the rules of war have altered beyond recognition. There are few that remember a time before war, even fewer that can fixate on a society that hadn't caved to machine. As the days go by Franchet becomes one of the many few that were born prior to Europe's great industrial awakening, time has slipped from his fingers and what he has left he has dedicated to building France anew. In a great tragedy he has seen man go from conquer to conquered and if one was to ask why he held such a disliking for mans greatest creations, he simply points to all the dead that roam flanders fields. For him he remains silent about his past, it matters little wether a grand story could be told of his life. If he had made one realisation, it would be tomorrow holds all the keys to mans success, or its destruction."

  PB_Hubert_Lyautey_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 17/11/1854\n\n§YHubert Lyautey§! is known as the 'French Empire Builder', serving as colonial administrator for French Algiers for the entirety of the 1890s has equiped Mr. Lyautey with all the tools necessary to be an effective general, and territorial overseer. He has put down numerous rebellions, namely the 1881 Indian-French uprising that nearly ended French control in India (now modern day British Madurai). With an established service record there is no doubts wether or not Mr. Lyautey will remain in French high society, he has also remained neutral in Military-SP affairs which is by far the smartest move he could possibly make. Though he may be a hot head at times Mr. Lyautey is a competent and loyal general with grand ambitions for both his name and France."

  PB_Charles_de_Gaulle_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 22/11/1890\n\n§YCharles de Gaulle§! was born for war. His father often encouraged discussion into French history and politics during dinner, here Charles become fascinated by French society and the ever changing political climate of the world. He took a keen interest in military strategy and by the age of 19 he joined the École militaire complex as a cadet officer. For the next few years Charles would establish himself as an educated and disciplined officer, and when war came calling on the homefront Charles offered his services to France in any way he saw fit.\n\nHaving seen the horrors of the Great War, and all the new inventions man had created to kill one another Charles had grown wary of a resurgent France. Though it has become ever so clear that France is once again on the war path, as a result Charles has placed his faith in the Popular Front party and now dedicates his time studying military theories both old and new. He may not be France's finest hero, but he is certainly capable of greatness."

  PB_Theophile_Brebant_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 24/5/1889\n\n§YTheophile Brebant§! witnessed Paris fall to the German and British hordes. The two week siege left Mr. Brebant terribly shellshocked, endless barrages of earth and metal does unspeakable things to a man and Mr. Brabant wasn't spared the worst of it. He grew a certain dislike of his invaders on a level other men never reach; constructing terrifying stereotypical recreations of the British and German man. Here he would tunnel his emotions towards these imaginative barbarians, it is therefore no surprise that when the SP promoted these very constructions Mr. Brabant quickly fell under their banner.\n\nWhile his outspoken support for the SP could one day cost him his head there are other issues Mr. Brabant must attend to, namely a faulty liver that he must repeatedly seek medical support for. Everyday his medical condition is worsened and his operational capacity is weakened, it seems France's greatest decade may be an unfinished paragraph in Mr. Brabant's story."

With the fall of Frankfurt, led by the chaos and division plagueing the Germans, several German officials and commanders have proposed negotiations regarding peace and ending our German war effort. With the British still on our tail, a German peace could allow us to focus our attention on the decadent British Empire. The new pro-French government has been established in Nuremberg under the German nationalist Anton Drexler and a group of other French collaborators that are willing to fight against the British empire and liberal democracy."

  French.2.d:0 "With the establishment of the Nuremberg Protectorate in the former Habsburg lands of Germany, a new question arises on the issue of German leadership. The current head of state, Anton Drexler, was the man to lead the peace treaty between the German collaborators and the French army. However, Drexler, like all German nationalist, is completely insane, corrupted by dark Germanic spells of romantic nationalism and pagan mythology. Many among our German occupation staff even belief that Drexler is the anti-christ himself. Thus, some have started to vouch for a new German head of state to replace Drexler. Several options have become staff favorites, but there has yet to be an official discussion about this change in management."

Many blame the German nationalists for their loyalty to France, starting the 'stab-in-the-back' myth among most urban citizens. Now, several groups of socialists, liberals and even other nationalists have formed an disunited partisan movement across Germany as to keep the collaboration government from helping the French war effort. These partisan movements have already begun to become a major problem for the collaboration government and many fear all-out revolt if anything bad would ever happen to the French war effort."

Despite the internal panic local authorities have maintained a neutral attitude on the topic, promising no loyalty to either of the three candidates.

  French.8.d:0 "Despite the lack of discipline, the SP proved to be a brutally effective mob. Their tactics were undoubtedly questionable but in times of great strife the rules of “war” change; and the definition of sane in an insane world is quite the ironic remark. Men tormented both physically and mentally resorted to this state funded police force, here they could avenge all the years of pain with little jurisdiction. Their mere presence birthed fearful stares in the least humane ways possible, after all everyone knew their purpose, they simply wondered who; who would be their next victim. Would it be a Jew? A drunk? Or a young woman? They were beasts of no nation, with no grand moral leader, no fathers or mothers, no job opportunities, they were the perfect killing machines and kill they did. When Doriot handed Darnard the lists his henchmen salivated at the untold stories they were about to write, the rapes and murders of thousands was about to take place and not even God knew how to handle the situation; yet he still showed pity like all the rest."

  French.9.d:0 "As night falls over Paris, members of Charles Maurras' Action Française party assemble for their annual party meeting in a Paris dining hall. Though there have been fears of potential violence at the hands of the pro-Doriot militias, little has seemingly happened over the past weeks to change Maurras' plans. The focus of this evening's meeting is the prospect of aligning with the Armandist faction of the FPF in order to unseat Doriot. Though Armand holds little love for the former monarchy, Maurras has promised reforms and concessions to the left-nationalists in exchange for their support.\n\nA final concern before the meeting begins is the issue of security. Given the incessant mood of paranoia that has fallen over Paris, it seems only natural to provide some degree of security to the attendees. Alternatively, as a means to strengthen the alliance with the left-nationals, they could be armed to provide security for the event."

They still gripped the old ways of tradition and aristocracy which so willingly put the common people of France through the Great War. If the coalition must be broken then so be it.. We shall disarm the monarchists for the betterment of France and install Armand as the rightful saviour of the French people. Armand shall become the defender of France and we; the French people shall be her blazing sword, even if it means cutting off the limb of traditionalism. Paris, in all its beauty, tells a depressing story from a bygone age; its woes, its struggles, and its ascendance will all be remembered but its existence will alter beyond recognition. As the fires of revolution spread, Paris, though old, will be reborn and with it a new era of thinking shall emerge. Empires, Kings, and Queens will experience the very pain France had to suffer; the word mercy from this point on will take a sinister definition and Maurras' clique will be the first to hear it, France shall be reborn tonight."

  French.15.d:0 "The grand cultural reconstruction has begun. Speaking before an assembled crowd at the Louvre, Grand Marshal Doriot announced the beginning of the \"Cultural Reconstruction\" of the French State. The Marshal declared that all forms of so-called \"degenerate\" art were to be destroyed for a wave of new French artistic expression, guided by the FPF. The Louvre, he declared, would be just the beginning of this new rebuilding of traditional French culture, free from the decadence and immorality of the Bourbons.\n\nFollowing this announcement, SP militants have begun ransacking museums and art galleries throughout Paris and the country, either destroying or looting a countless number of priceless works. In the Louvre alone, much of the Republican-era modern art has been destroyed, though many of the museuem's most important pieces were quietly evacuated before the SP could invade. Most notably, Da Vinci's Mona Lisa was reported stolen and taken to Italy by \"traitorous Maurras sympathizers\".\n\nFrance, once a cultural capital of the world, has had its' heart sliced out by the new regime. The skies around Paris blacken with the ash of thousands of burnt canvases."

  French.16.d:0 "Yet again, the Grand Marshal addresses the nation. The next edict of the cultural reconstruction is to target France's past, more specifically, its' Bourbon heritage. Doriot, in an effort to further cement the absolute power of the state, has ordered the mass demolition of any buildings or monuments erected by the former Bourbon monarchy.\n\n\"The weakness of the former Emperors shall not be that of the New France\", he stated to an assembled crowd in Paris. Not only this, but the former nobility of the French state, or at least those that have not already fled, are to be killed or detained. Over a hundred former civil servants, nobles, and pro-Bourbon business owners have been detained and have seemingly vanished, likely killed by the SP or the increasingly militant Doriot Youth clubs that have popped up throughout the nation."
  French.16.a:0 "The World will never know they existed."

  French.17.t:0 "The Cultural Reconstruction - Edict on the Future"
  French.17.d:0 "As the Cultural Reconstruction reaches a fever pitch, the Grand Marshal has made his last edict on the matter, detailing his manifesto for the future of France. His plan is ambitious to say the least, and equally disquieting for those he has declared his regime against. A series of laws are to be implemented officially banning anyone of German heritage from public office or business ownership. Laws against France's not insignifcant Jewish population have been enacted, with the Doriot regime declaring them as \"racial fifth columnists\" to the French people.\n\nCoupled with these new racial laws is a \"generation plan\" proposed by the regime intended to dramatically increase France's birth rate over the course of the next decade. The Generation Plan is intended to create an \"ethnically pure\" France with a population to outgrow Europe's German diaspora.\n\nAlready, thousands of German, Jewish, and other minority groups have begun a mass exodus from France. Across the nation, German border communities and synagogues burn as the SP begins to enact the Grand Marshal's will."

  French.18.t:0 "The Cultural Reconstruction - Edict on the Church"
  French.18.d:0 "Yet another victim of the Cultural Reconstruction has been France's majority religion, Catholicism. While the Doriotist faction of the FPF had previously maintained neutrality on religious affairs, this was a compromise of convenience rather than ideology. Citing the pro-Catholic policies of the now purged Maurras faction, the FPF has set off a wave of violence throughout France against the Catholic Church in France in an effort to violently secularize the country\n\nSpeaking over the radio on the issue, the Grand Marshal declared \"the authority of the clergy, entrenched by the weak monarchy, is a danger to the moral fortitude of the new French people.\" This phase of the Reconstruction has proven the most divisive to the French people, a plurality of which are Catholic or at least Christian. Significant resistance has come from the countryside and many townships are under assault by the SP for their refusal to accept the new forced secularization. In the place of religion, the Doriot regime has begun to push a new doctrine of \"National Worship\", effectively attempting to craft their own new religion out of reverence for the state and the French people. Condemnations have naturally been issued by both Naples and Frankfurt, with both governments offering to open their borders to religious refugees."

The Remilitarization of Lorraine is but the first step in a series of processes to ensure total French hegemony in the following years, before we know it our troops will be marching through the cities of Berlin, Vienna, and Nuremberg singing and dancing like the Germans did so long ago. Yet we shall go the extra step, not only will we guarantee that Germany remains neutered from global affairs, but we will fundamentally change their society as a whole.

Though the fields laid torn and permanently scarred, not too different from those long ago, victory along with all its burden was finally achieved. While some individuals are enslaved, others subjected, there are also those that have been liberated. While one may ponder on the lasting effects such a war may have, for the time being many can rest knowing mans destruction is of a future concern; that is unless old squabbles refuse to die. It is far too soon to make out whether Paris will rule the next century in a period of gold, even sooner to tell if humanity can reject its primitive ways. War, borders, and insignificant differences can make everything we’ve ever worked towards ultimately pointless. Yet it is these very issues that we as a society strive to overcome, otherwise are we truly human? While the era of British peace has finally come to an end, a new era has been birthed. Peaceful or not continental Europe will enjoy a new master, one not confined to the British ways of thought. "

The victim smelt of a grossly mix of sweat and piss, it was a rather embarrassing circumstance to be in. The SP officer and his goons began to laugh hysterically, somewhere in Paris, on a quite suburban street stood four men in uniform staring at a hopelesss figure of a human on the ground, begging like a dog for mercy. The men simply continued their rampage of laughter until the SP officer finally brought himself under control. The soliders quickly shut themselves up and at that moment in time the only sound that could be heard was the sobbing of the victim and the occasional barking of a street mutt.\n\n"Please, please, please... I beg of you; I gave everything to the party." Cried the victim but the perpetrators showed no remorse. The victim's mind raced with thoughts and the stench of fear began to become unbearable to the officer. His hand crawled down his right leg and came to a complete stop, resting itself on the belt of a holster. The victims crying only escalated as a result and in a proccess to shut the man up a solider knocked him over the head with the butt of his rifle. The crying finally stopped and only a few snobs and sniffs remained. The officer drawed his pistol to the forehead of the victim. Silence, complete silence then followed. The streets of Paris heard a thud that night, and a thousand thuds were soon to follow."

  French_flavour.7.d:0 "Before he could realize it, Antoine was forcefully picked up again by the same soldiers that had pulled him onto the military truck that faithfull night. With his knees painfully scraping over the dirty, cold ground, Antoine received a hard fist to his jaw. “Your feet still work pig, don’t try and be petty”, the soldier holding his left arm shouted.\n\nWith the cold dawn setting in, Antoine reached the large facility on the outskirt of some random forest in the French countryside. The sounds of toiling men and women were drowned out by the sounds of iron doors and the wooden stocks of guns hitting flesh. Before he could properly take in the atmosphere, Antoine was thrown into what looked like a temporary holding cell. The door behind him shut and he was left in the dark, yet he still wasn’t alone. One other soul was also in this dark room, his or her eyes glowing with the small bit of light that came into this room through the small window. “Are you alright”, he or she asked. A soft hand touched Antoine’s elbow, feeling the bit of skin that was scraped off him by the fall into his new home. “I would have helped you, but there’s not even some linen I could use to patch you up”. It was nice that at least some people haven’t lost their humanity in these trying times, Antoine thought.\n\nBefore he could reply, the light from the window dimmed as a man stood behind it. “Rest while you still can, tomorrow is your first day of labour”."

  French_flavour.8.t:0 "A Vain Hope for the Degenerate"
  French_flavour.8.d:0 "The rhythm of steel on stone echoed through the quarry localized in the labour camp, as Antoine’s pickaxe followed the pattern of the other undesirables stuck there. It was a couple of months since he had been thrown into that temporary holding facility and he had since then moved to the crowded barracks near the eastern side of the camp. Once there, he was given a number and was stripped of his old clothes, having to work, sleep and eat in something that barely resembles clothing. He was, however, fortunate enough to sleep in the eastern barracks instead of the western, as a recent cholera outbreak had wiped half of the population there. Some had talked about a planned outbreak to free up space for more undesirables, but the hygiene was honestly so poor in this camp that it could have gone either way.\n\nWith the last stone broken, Antoine got his food and ate alone near the fence. From there, he could see the outskirts of the forest: a tease of freedom, of hope. As he picked up another piece of his dry bread, someone came up to him, wearing the same cloth he wore. Sitting down next to him, Antoine recognized the man that just approached him: it was the same soul he had met months ago in the holding cell. “Good to see that you’re still alive Antoine, how’s work”.\n\nAfter a short amount of chit chat between the two, the man that he now knew was called Michel started to look serious. Looking around him, Michel sneakily gave Antoine another piece of bread before he continued. “I’m guessing that you aren’t looking to waste your life in this prison camp, so I have an offer to propose. I’ve assembled a few of the others with a plan to leave this place without raising suspicion. We have a man on the outside that has promised us a trip out of France, presumably to Switzerland. We don’t have much room, but we could use someone like you to help us get out of here”.\n\nAntoine didn’t skip a heartbeat and answered:\nAlright, let’s get out of here"

  French_flavour.9.d:0 "Under the light of the moon, they had escaped their camp. Antoine, Michel and a couple of other men were now hidden in the forest near the camp, running barefoot through the mud and on the stones. It wouldn’t be long before camp security would notice prisoners missing, so they had only a few hours to reach Michel’s contact.\n\nSwiftly yet quietly, the men sneaked through the forest, watching for fallen branches and crunchy leaves. Despite the darkness, the moon allowed them to be stealthy. At the end of the night, as the sun broke through the morning dawn, they finally reached open plains. Michel pointed across the grass to a figure standing there, waving. “Our contact, he’s the one that will stow us away on a train towards Switzerland”. A sense of celebration filled Antoine.\n\nThat was when the first man fell.\n\nLoud bangs ringed through the forest as French soldiers gave away their position. It was an ambush. Our contact had betrayed us. Bullets flew across the field. Michel, barely breathing due to the wound in his chest, told Antoine his last words: “Take care, Antoine”. Antoine could not cry now, so he ran, hidden behind tall grass, bushes and trees. He ran. His feet started bleeding but he did not care. He only ran.\n\nAfter hours of running, Antoine collapsed. He was in the middle of nowhere with nobody else. All the others were presumably dead. He was alone.\n\nFor the first time in months, Antoine cried"

  French_flavour.10.d:0 "It had been a couple of weeks since the ambush, yet you would not be able to tell that from Antoine alone. His face was pale and he had nurtured wrinkles around his bloodshot eyes, yet he did not give up. He got away and he would fight for his freedom.\n\nDespite his mental state, Antoine hadn’t given up. On nothing more than his bleeding feet, he had reached Calais, the biggest city near the Franco-British sea border. Yet, as a wanted fugitive, he could not simply walk into Calais and expect to be treated well. He would most likely be shot on sight if people found out. So he waited for the sun to set, scavenging food during the night and resting in an abandoned barn outside the city. This ritual went on for a few weeks, but Antoine could not afford to stay too long in this position. People would find out eventually of his shenanigans. So he hatched a last-ditch suicide plan. If this would not work, he was a dead man.\n\nThat night, he didn’t go to Calais to scavenge. Running around the semi-busy port, Antoine finally found what he was looking for: a British ship preparing to return to Dover. Yet the vessel was not very large and most likely not one for trade. Stowing away would be fairly risky on such a small boat, yet he could always try. Leaving a bloody trail of footprints, Antoine entered the deck of the ship and hid away in a cupboard.\n\nBefore he could feel the ship depart however, the cupboard was opened. Two curious eyes stared at Antoine and Antoine stared back. In a heavy North England accent, the man with the curious eyes asked: “and who are you, just sitting in this cupboard”? Antoine did not understand English, but that did not stop him pleading in French. Tears swell up, yet the Anglo did not seem to understand him. With his hands full of dirt Antoine pleaded and pleaded, stopping to take a breath here and there, but the English sailor stopped him.\n\n“I do not necessarily understand what you’re saying, but I know a man fearing for his life when I see one”. Again, Antoine did not understand, but the sailor tried to calm him down. He pointed at the deck and made a gesture to keep quiet. For the first time since he was forcefully detained, Antoine felt good. And as the sailor closed the cupboard, planning to keep it a secret until they reached Dover, tears fell from Antoine’s cheeks. Not of fear, anger or despair, but of joy.\n\nFinally, Antoine was free"

Often, they talked about one particular old man, settled in a small villa on the outskirts of Montreal. While clearly French, the man did not speak in the particular Quebec dialect of the region, but in a Parisian one. That is, if he ever spoke to you. Generally, he just mumbled while rocking in his chair with his wife, watching over his modest estate. Threats and vulgarity are often exchanged between him and the locals, may they be Quebecois or Anglo.\n\nThe main rumour Richard knows about old mister Philips is that people think he might have been in the military. Some swore they’ve seen the man walk through his front garden in a military uniform, unlike any on the entire American continent, his badges sparkling in the low spring sun.\n\nAs he walks along the estate, Richard peaks through the fence for a second. There he saw mister Philips, completely alone. Instead of his military uniform or the glorious badges he may have won during the War, the old man stared at a piece of torn cloth, painted in blue, white and red. Richard swore that he saw a single tear drop from his old face before mister Philips saw him peeking through the fence. And as he often did, the old man threatened many things to happen to Richard’s mother."

However, today was a busy day due to a little problem mom had had with the police, so Pierre was given a few Francs and the task to buy a loaf of bread. With the warm loaf in his small hands, Pierre took the usual shortcut through an alley.\n\nThere, Pierre saw him. A large man in a coat, sitting on the ground. His weary eyes pointed at little Pierre, either scared or hungry. Or perhaps even both? Before Pierre fully understood the situation, the man started begging for some bread. “Please little man, I’m so hungry. I haven’t eaten in days now and my stomach hurts”. Pierre, moved by this gesture, tore some bread from the loaf and was about to hand it to the hungry man, before noticing a small, orange badge on his coat.\n\nMom had told Pierre of those people with orange badges, often in the bedtime stories she read for him. They were monsters, hungering for little boys. He had seen that hunger in his eyes just a second ago and he knew that he would be eaten. Pierre screamed. People from the busy streets swarmed the small alley in seconds, calling for the police and pulling the man from the ground, tearing at his coat. When the police finally came over, the man with the orange badge was pulled out of the alley and into a black police car.

Joseph exhaled the smoke, making the already grim room a little bit more gray.\n\n“I didn’t become a journalist to write what people want to hear, Joseph, I became one to fuck up some corrupt folk and uncover some unpleasant truths”. Joseph laughed a bit before inhaling another cloud of smoke. A combination of laughing and coughing followed. “Well, why don’t you start with [FRA.GetLeader] and see how long your neck will be attached to the rest of that young body of yours”. It wasn’t a wonder that Joseph was as defeatist as he was, but it was quite a contrast to a few years ago, when he often pulled the rug under big politicians when democracy was still in place.\n\nBefore Eugene could answer Joseph's sarcastic remark, the sound of car doors closing came from outside. In a few seconds, soldiers were at the doors of the building. As Joseph opened the door, he was pushed to the side of his own business, blood flowing out of his nose. Before a bit of that old spirit in Joseph could demand an answer out of that brute called a soldier, a man in a coat entered. “Monsieur Joseph, I’ve come here to inform you of some important information for the future of your little paper. If we could speak in your office under four eyes, that would be greatly appreciated”.\n\nAfter a short 15 minutes, the man in the dark coat left the building with his soldiers.

Compared to the math or history teacher, Monsieur Barthou was far more passionate about his subject and his students noticed, listening to his every word, almost entranced by his passion. “The nose, the fuller lips and the elegant jawline of every pure-blooded Frenchman is directly connected to the eugenic superiority of the Roman race. Compare that to the frail Anglo or the barbarian Hun and you clearly see the difference”. As Barthou pointed to the big brow bone of the Brit and the German, he swiftly pointed at the Italian next. “Despite their claimed ancestry to the Roman people, the Italians of today are more closely connected to the barbarians that invaded Rome and thus the Germanic people. Unlike them, the Spaniards and Portuguese possess that same strong jawline and full lipset of the Romans and Franks and are thus in a similar genetic class as the Franks.\n\nWhipping out another chart, monsieur Barthou continued his class on Frankish studies on the subject of undesirables. “Notice how the Yiddish people or the people without a state have far less in common with the European races than with the Africans or Indians. Even the brutes in Germany have a more elegant posture and more European appearance than those that pray to the Torah or those who steal”. Another picture was drawn on the board with chalk. “But the most undesirable of all people remains the Russians. A fusion of the worst of the German, the worst of the Chinaman and the worst of the Yid, the Russian is a true genetic abomination that taints the claim of being European or even being human”.

  French_flavour.38.t:0 "The Last Sermon"
  French_flavour.38.d:0 "“Father Lazare, are you alright? You seemed rather out of it during this sermon”. Josephine’s comment took the old father a bit aback, but he quickly regained the posture worthy of a friendly priest. “No worries my child, I’ve just been rather sad about the attendance of our community these last months. Barely any familiar faces frequent the church anymore”. The young woman before him nodded. In the last few months, fewer and fewer people from the town had been going regularly to the church. Even her own relatives, such as her four younger brothers, had been skipping church.\n\n“Ever since Doriot has been a vocal critic of religion, the church has seen fewer people come”, Father Lazare sighed. “I prayed many nights now to God that Doriot may change his ways, but it does not seem like my prayers will be answered”. Josephine nodded again. Seeing the old priest in such distress was rather heartbreaking. “And the worst part is that I’m somewhat responsible for this mess. I would have never voted for the Front if I knew Doriot would oppose the Lord’s words”. Josephine stopped nodding, looking slightly scared. Who knew if anyone else in the church was a member of the SP. If this little chat would leak, she could lose her job or her freedom. Father Lazare saw it in Josephine’s eyes and nodded. “I think that it’s better to end this chat here. May the Lord bless your health and safety, child”.\n\nA few months later, Father Lazare was replaced by a new, less critical priest."

  French_flavour.39.d:0 "It had been an exciting prospect to Louis and Marie Lebrun: a house entirely compensated by the state for the lovely pair with six children. While Nancy was rather far from Louis’ old job in Marseille, government officials had richly compensated the two with a 5-year long job compensation subsidy and a free job for Louis that could sustain a bigger household. Sounding like a dream came true, the loving pair packed their bags and moved to Nancy.\n\nThe house wasn’t disappointing, being a modestly large house in the outskirts of the city. Louis did notice how quiet the neighbourhood was, almost as if it was devoid of any life, but the official promised that it was just for a couple of weeks, as other French pairs would also move into Nancy in a month. The house itself seemed fine, though it still had a fair share of problems that needed fixing, such as a few broken doors, random pieces of glass spread across the living room and blackened stains on the attic floor. However, despite its problems, Louis and Marie loved it and quickly moved in.\n\nOn a lovely Monday evening, while fixing up the house here and there, Louis was up in the attic, replacing some rotten wooden planks with new ones. However, when he tore open the last rotten plank, he found something behind the old planks. Pulling it out of the cobwebs, Louis held a large piece of fabric in the shape of a flag. On it was a proud black eagle flying over a yellow background. That same day, Louis would burn that proud eagle in his backyard. His children wouldn’t be burdened with that kind of knowledge.\n\nAnd so, the eagle was replaced by the tricolour."

A disapproving stare answered Eberhard’s nervous laughter. “Sorry, but krauts cannot be part of the proletariat or the union”. The disapproving stares now also came from the queue behind him, as people mumbled insults and vulgarity in French. “How’s that fair”, Eberhard replied, “aren’t we all brothers in labour, chained by the international bourgeoisie? How can one not be part of the proletariat due to nationality”.\n\nThe man slammed the desk, while the people behind him became silent. “Listen you imperialist, reactionary thought is in your blood. You simply can not be German and part of the international proletariat. You’re a capitalist in your genes and not allowed in any French labour union”. Eberhard stood there, silent. “Here are your papers and note that you’re barred from ever becoming a member of any labour union in France due to your German heritage. We all share a government blacklist and Germans like you are generally on there”.

Opposing the Militarists is the Sécurité publique, the paramilitary arm of the French Popular Party. These two factions harbor a deep distrust of one another, with the Militarists seeing the SP as too fanatical and the SP seeing the military as ideological fifth columnists.\n\nBoth factions wish to see their influence dominant the French government, however if either faction gains too much political power, it could lead to §Rdramatic consequences§! for the current ruling party. Despite this, shifting power to either faction can grant bonuses to the military or the political scene, while keeping them balanced will only provide very small gains.
