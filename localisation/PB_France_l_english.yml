 FRA_Order_Through_Diplomacy:0 "Order through Diplomacy"
 FRA_Order_Through_Diplomacy_desc:0 "Given the current militancy of the Communists and Far Right, it might be wise to approach the former to see if they’d be willing to make some concessions for the common good. Potentially either forming a coalition or agreeing to some of their requests might help to relieve some pressure on the current government."

 FRA_Maintain_the_Welfare_State:0 "Maintain the Welfare State"
 FRA_Maintain_the_Welfare_State_desc:0 "Many of the reforms passed by the Blum administration have improved the lives of the average Frenchman. Providing a basic minimum wage and public works programmes to keep unemployment manageable should be a top priority for the newly re-elected Social Democrats."

 FRA_Workers_Rights_Amendment:0 "The Worker's Rights Amendment"
 FRA_Workers_Rights_Amendment_desc:0 "The Worker’s Rights Act is a proposed programme to expand, as expected, worker’s rights throughout France. While we already have comprehensive programmes to protect workers, such an act would go far to help combat Communist extremism."

 FRA_Develop_Metropolitan_France:0 "Develop Metropolitan France"
 FRA_Revolutionary_Crisis_Averted_tooltip:0 "§G The Revolutionary Crisis has been averted or the Nationalists have won in the French Civil War§!\n"
 FRA_Develop_Metropolitan_France_desc:0 "Metropolitan France is the beating heart of the Empire. We should expand the nation’s infrastructure and invest in new industrial complexes to improve it."

 FRA_Detente_with_Britain:0 "Detente with Britain"
 FRA_Detente_with_Britain_desc:0 "While we’ve had our differences with the British, the greater threat lies East of the Rhine. Reducing tensions with the British Empire would help to bridge the gap that grew between our two nations."

 FRA_Rhineland_Status:0 "Status of the Rhineland"
 FRA_Rhineland_Status_desc:0 "The occupation of the Rhineland, and the subsequent creation of the Rhenish Republic, was a desperate move to prevent German communist expansionism from crossing into France. With public opinion largely against continuing the occupation, it might be time to consider other alternatives."

 FRA_National_Rearmament_Campaign:0 "National Rearmament Campaign"
 FRA_National_Rearmament_Campaign.tt:0 "£decision_icon_small §GUnlocks Decisions for the National Rearmament Campaign§!\n"
 FRA_National_Rearmament_Campaign_desc:0 "Since the Great War, pacifism and anti-war ideals have become commonplace throughout France, and not for unjustified reasons. With the rise of a renewed Austria and potential for German expansionism, we must take to mobilizing the population once more to defend France."

 FRA_Radical_Reform_Plan:0 "The Radical Reform Plan"
 FRA_Radical_Reform_Plan_desc:0 "Among the many reforms proposed by the Thorez government is the “Radical Reform” plan, intended to dramatically overhaul the French economy and begin the process of ending the Economic Depression which has gripped the nation since the Weimar Civil War. Though opposed by conservatives, the plan could potentially remedy many of France’s economic woes."

 FRA_Anti_Colonialist_Sentiment:0 "Anti-Colonialist Sentiment"
 FRA_Anti_Colonialist_Sentiment_desc:0 "Colonialism, though a backbone of the French state, has become woefully inefficient in recent years. Shifting away from it and towards a more British-style home rule model might go a long way towards dealing with our economic problems."

 FRA_Paris_Imperial_Conference:0 "The First Paris Imperial Conference"
 FRA_Paris_Imperial_Conference_desc:0 "Many of our colonies operate almost independently of the Paris mandate, and thus can be inefficient in administration. Bringing all our colonial leaders together to establish a general doctrine towards how we handle the colonies will dramatically improve our administrative capabilities."

 FRA_Restore_Order:0 "Restore Order in the West"
 FRA_Restore_Order_desc:0 "Since the election, the National Salvation Front has become a serious problem in Western France. Reasserting control over Western France should be a paramount concern to the administration."

 FRA_The_Petain_Problem:0 "The Pétain Problem"
 FRA_The_Petain_Problem_desc:0 "Phillipe Pétain, the aging Great War general, has become a major figurehead for the authoritarian, absolutist and ultranationalist movements in the National Salvation Front. Eliminating him could potentially cut the head off the snake, and end FSN agitation so we can bring stability back to France."

 FRA_Corporatism:0 "Corporatism"
 FRA_Corporatism_desc:0 "A small cabal of corporate leaders have approached our administration, proposing that we push to guide the economy along a more corporate-leaning manner. These so-called Corporatists would effectively act as technocrats, pushing our economy along in a manner not unlike other state capitalist agendas."

 FRA_Union_Crackdowns:0 "Crackdown on Unionism"
 FRA_Union_Crackdowns_desc:0 "Unionism has become a serious issue throughout France, as well as a major source of socialist agitation. Cracking down on them would naturally also strike at the heart of socialist organization within the country."

 FRA_Order_through_Strength:0 "Order through Strength"
 FRA_Order_through_Strength.tt:0 "£decision_icon_small §GUnlocks Decisions for Nationwide Pacification§!\n"

 FRA_Versailles_Fire_tooltip:0 "§R The Versailles Fire has occurred §!\n"
 FRA_Versailles_Fire_Decree_desc:0 "The destruction of the Palace at Versailles has exposed a dangerous threat to the French nation. If the socialists and communists continue to be allowed to spread their chaos unimpeded, they will surely spell death for the nation. We must end this frightful experiment with democracy."

 FRA_Suspend_Democracy:0 "Suspend the Estates-General"
 FRA_Suspend_Democracy_desc:0 "Restoring order means making difficult decisions, and suspending the Estates-General will, at least temporarily, end any chances of further socialist agitation while the Marshall’s new government tries to assert full control over France."

 # IMPERIAL FRANCE IDEAS
 ########################
 FRA_bourbon_monarchy:0 "The Bourbon Dual Monarchy"
 FRA_bourbon_monarchy_desc:0 "For centuries, France has been under the rule of the Bourbon dynasty. The constitutionalism of the dynasty can be traced back to Louis XVI and the French Reformation, which established the French Kingdom as a constitutional democratic state. Deaths within the French branch of the dynasty have led to the current oddity of the monarchy. Alfonso XIII of Spain is technically the true king of both France and Spain, but due to the logistical difficulties of such, his heir apparent Alfonso of Asturias currently reigns over France."
 FRA_opium_dividends:0 "Opium Trade Dividends"
 FRA_opium_dividends_desc:0 "France has been at the forefront of imperialism in Asia since the Opium Wars against the Qing dynasty. Trade into Guangdong and China is routed through the Treaty Port of Hong Kong, as well as through the border at French Indochina. This situation is less than optimal for the Chinese, but French traders are more than willing to abide it."
 FRA_Colonial_Upkeep_Costs:0 "High Colonial Upkeep Costs"
 FRA_Colonial_Upkeep_Costs_desc:0 "The rivalry with the British, Dutch and Portuguese has driven France to establish the second largest empire on the planet. However, despite access to vast resources and colonies, France has nearly bankrupted herself attempting to maintain this empire. Unwilling to adopt the British System of home rule, France is expending incredible amounts of capital that she sorely lacks on maintaining an empire that seems more and more precarious by the day."
 FRA_Postwar_Pacifism:0 "Postwar Pacifism"
 FRA_Postwar_Pacifism_desc:0 "France suffered greatly during the First Great War, having taken the brunt of the German assault. The deaths of millions did not weigh easy on the French population, and many adopted ideas that the war could never be allowed to happen again. Decades have allowed this pacifism and cynicism to entrench throughout the French consciousness, and it will take a great upheaval to convince the French people to take up arms once more to defend their nation."

Homelessness, crime and poverty have become commonplace in many French cities and towns, spurring many towards radical ideals."

 # IMPERIAL FRANCE EVENTS
 #########################
 france.1.t:0 "Anti-Occupation Demonstrations in Paris"
 france.1.d:0 "The year has already been kicked off with demonstrations in Paris against our occupation of the Rhineland. The Rhenish Republic, a buffer puppet state between France and Germany, has existed since the armistice of the German Civil War. The occupation of the Rhineland has been a point of contention within the government, as many see it as a needless waste of resources. Others, particularly the growing National Salvation Front, think that our hold should be tightened on the region, fully integrating it into a so-called “Greater France.” Beyond the typical bluster of such demonstrations, only a major upheaval seems likely to change our policy on the region."
 france.1.a:0 "Eh. Let them shout."

 france.2.t:0 "Pétain announces his candidacy"
 france.2.d:0 "Philippe Pétain, a long-standing member of the National Salvation Front, has announced his intention to run for the office of prime minister in the upcoming elections. A hero of the French front of the Great War, Pétain has lead the moderate faction of the front since his retirement from military affairs just over ten years ago. While chided by the more far-right elements of his party, Pétain has already begun to capitalize on the economic downturn to begin a series of rallies through the traditionally conservative regions of the French interior."
 france.2.a:0 "Perhaps a firmer hand is needed?"

 france.3.t:0 "Thorez announces his candidacy"
 france.3.d:0 "Maurice Thorez, current head of the Popular Front, announced his candidacy for the prime ministership today. Thorez has pushed an agenda of decolonization and expansion of the welfare programs created after the Great War. His anti-imperial policies, as well as his former associations with the hardline New Jacobin party from which his split from, has gained him little fanfare outside metropolitan France. Nonetheless, if he can tap the exposed nerve of disenfranchised Frenchmen, the Popular Front could finally see greater control within the halls of the Estates-General."
 france.3.a:0 "Damned socialists..."

 france.4.t:0 "Colonial Debt Problems"
 france.4.d:0 "With our economy in a major downturn, we’re forced to re-examine our colonial funding. Currently, we’re spending millions a year that we simply don’t have anymore on security measures and infrastructure. However, reducing colonial funding will reduce the efficacy of our colonial security forces, and could make it easier for insurrectionist movements to grow. On the other hand, keeping our colonial budget as is will make it much more difficult to get our economy moving again. A possible compromise would be to shift resources to simply maintaining our North African colonies, which are traditionally quieter and more integrated into France proper."
 france.4.a:0 "Slash colonial funding and focus on France proper."
 france.4.b:0 "Focus our funding towards Africa"
 france.4.c:0 "We'll pay it off later."

 france.5.t:0 "The NSF gains support in Vichy"
 france.5.d:0 "Pétain’s National Salvation Front continues to gain steam in light of the economic crisis. In a rousing speech at the Vichy town hall, the war hero promised a return to normalcy for the French people and to restore the Empire’s honour on the world stage. Polls indicate that Pétain has considerable support in the more rural regions of France, while having gained less traction in the more metropolitan centers. The election is projected to be extremely close."
 france.5.a:0 "Let's see how this plays out."

 france.6.t:0 "Poverty grips the Countryside"
 france.6.d:0 "The economic crisis continues and with it, poverty has begun to grow throughout the nation. The countryside has especially felt the sting, as millions have been laid off from their jobs due to companies going under. This has only served to further radicalize the population, who in many regions have flocked to the banner of the National Salvation Front or even the New Jacobins, both promising a return to imperial glory. Even the radical faction of the NSF, headed by Jacques Doriot, has gained some appeal, aided by anti-semitic and anti-foreigner sentiments that have grown more public since the crisis."
 france.6.a:0 "Unfortunate"

 france.7.t:0 "General Strike in Wallonia"
 france.7.d:0 "The crisis drags on, and with it comes yet another. In Wallonia, factory and dockyard workers have staged a general strike, effectively grinding industry in the region to a halt. The Strike has become a beacon for many leftists in light of the election, including Thorez and even Jacques Duclos of the New Jacobin Party. Cracking down on the strike will severely damage our support, but will decisively end the strike here and now. Alternatively, we can let the strike continue to its’ conclusion and proceed as usual."
 france.7.a:0 "Force them back into the factories!"
 france.7.b:0 "Not worth our time."

 france.8.t:0 "The French Provincial Elections begin"
 france.8.d:0 "The Estates-General has dissolved in preparation for the upcoming French provincial elections. The people of France will be tasked soon with electing their ministers to the Estates-General, in what is shaping up to be one of the most contentious elections in recent memory. Leon Blum’s Parti Radical is seeking to maintain their position as the majority party, while Maurice Thorez and the socialist Popular Front is looking to gain their own majority for a radical economic reform plan. Similarly, Petain’s National Salvation Front is looking to finally edge into politics through appealing to rural, conservative voters."
 france.8.a:0 "Let's see how this goes..."

 france.9.t:0 "French Provincial Elections - Southern France"
 france.9.d:0 "Voters head to the polls today in Southern France to vote for their preferred party. Both Parti Radical and the Popular Front have made major pushes to gain votes, but it remains to be seen how things will play out."
 france.9.a:0 "Parti Radical wins the Majority"
 france.9.b:0 "The Popular Front wins the Majority"
 france.9.c:0 "The Salvation Front wins the Majority"

 france.10.t:0 "French Provincial Elections - Central France"
 france.10.d:0 "Voters head to the polls today in Central France to vote for their preferred party. Many parties are pushing for a victory, but it seems likely that Petain’s National Salvation Front is going to squeeze out a narrow victory."
 france.10.a:0 "Parti Radical wins the Majority"
 france.10.b:0 "The Popular Front wins the Majority"
 france.10.c:0 "The Salvation Front wins the Majority"

 france.11.t:0 "French Provincial Elections - Northern France"
 france.11.d:0 "Voters head to the polls today in Central France to vote for their preferred party. Many parties are pushing for a victory, but the polls appear to be extremely narrow."
 france.11.a:0 "Parti Radical wins the Majority"
 france.11.b:0 "The Popular Front wins the Majority"
 france.11.c:0 "The Salvation Front wins the Majority"

 france.12.t:0 "1936 Estates-General Elections - Parti Radical Victory"
 france.12.d:0 "After a tense election cycle, a victor has finally come out on top. Leon Blum’s Parti Radical has maintained their majority in the Estates-General, narrowly beating out the opposition. Though there have been protests from both the NSF and the Popular Front, both have ceded the victory to Blum, who hopes to spin this into de-radicalizing French politics. Whether his efforts will succeed or fail remains to be seen."
 france.12.a:0 "A victory for the status quo!"

 france.13.t:0 "1936 Estates-General Elections - FSN Victory"
 france.13.d:0 "After a tense election cycle, a victor has finally come out on top. Phillipe Pétain and the National Salvation Front have gained a majority in the Estates-General. Having garnered the support of rural voters and the aristocratic upper class, Pétain’s traditionalist mindset is sure to upset the previously progressively-minded Blum government. Thorez, though he has conceded the race, faces growing opposition within his own party from the increasingly powerful New Jacobin movement. Whether or not Pétain can keep France together remains to be seen."
 france.13.a:0 "A victory for the common man!"

 france.14.t:0 "1936 Estates-General Elections - Popular Front Victory"
 france.14.d:0 "After a tense election cycle, a victor has finally come out on top. Maurice Thorez and the Popular Front have secured a majority in the Estates-General. Thorez, a moderate socialist, is backed largely by the various Trade Unions and the metropolitan working class. The new administration already faces problems, as while Pétain has conceded the race, the Socialists are likely to face stiff resistance from the aging general’s voter base. Threats are within, as well as without, as the New Jacobin bloc of the new Administration, though it holds little real power, could potentially spin this victory into more votes next election."
 france.14.a:0 "A victory for the working man!"

 france.15.t:0 "Growing Jacobin Militancy"
 france.15.d:0 "With tensions still high over the recent election cycle, some disturbing reports have come to our attention. The New Jacobins, the hardline revolutionary branch of the Popular Front, have begun to show signs of militancy. Police in Eastern France have reported a sharp increase in confrontations with members of the group, particular the youth branch of the organization. "
 france.15.a:0 "We should probably do something about that."

 france.16.t:0 "Jacobin Militias raid Arms Depot"
 france.16.d:0 "As tensions continue to grow between the local authorities and the Jacobins, a group of armed militants have raided an arms depot in Eastern France. Not only were a myriad of weapons stolen, but almost a hundred of our own men deserted their post to join the terrorists! If tensions continue to spiral out of control, we may be facing an open insurrection!"
 france.16.a:0 "Tell Thorez to get his people under control!"

 france.17.t:0 "Militancy in the National Salvation Front"
 france.17.d:0 "It seems that not only are the Communists growing militant, but so is the National Salvation Front. While the former Field Marshall himself has not commented, there has been a growing push for NSF supporters to begin arming themselves against the “growing bolshevik threat.” Much of this has come from the Ultranationalist branch of the party, with both Bucard and Doriot seemingly setting their differences aside against a perceived common enemy. We’ve already received reports of minor, politically motivated violence in rural France. It seems the post-election chaos is far from over."
 france.17.a:0 "This is getting out of hand. Now there are two of them!"

 france.18.t:0 "Approaching the Jacobins"
 france.18.d:0 "Since the elections, the Jacobin branch of the Popular Front has become increasingly militant. Several small militia groups have formed in opposition to our government, and while they have little public support right now, that might not remain. In an attempt to maintain our stability, Prime Minister Blum has proposed that we approach the leadership of the popular front in order to reach some kind of common ground. The Prime Minister suggests that his position as a former member of the Popular Front might lend him the credentials to speak with Thorez and the Jacobins."
 france.18.a:0 "Offer to form a coalition government with the Popular Front"
 france.18.b:0 "Offer a comprehensive labour agreement"
 france.18.c:0 "Have the Jacobin leadership arrested!"

 france.19.t:0 "The Worker's Rights Amendment"
 france.19.d:0 "As part of our continuing efforts to secure the stability of France, Prime Minister Blum has proposed an amendment to the French constitution securing the rights of the working class. Referred to as the Worker’s Rights Amendment, Blum’s plan would enact by constitutional decree the ability for collective bargaining and rights for the working class against exploitation. While it won’t win us any favors from the Conservatives, the act may help to win the support of the Popular Front, who can in turn try and reduce the militancy of the Jacobins, who are acting increasingly independent of their moderate comrades."
 france.19.a:0 "Force the Act through the Estates-General!"
 france.19.b:0 "The Act fails to gain enough support."

 france.20.t:0 "Assassination attempt on the King-Regent!"
 france.20.d:0 "In Paris today, King-Regent Alphonse was speaking before a gathered crowd regarding the recent crisis. In the midst of his speech, an unknown assailant emerged from the crowd and fired a pistol, injuring the King-Regent! The assassin escaped in the chaos, but several underground communist militant groups have already claimed responsibility."
 france.20.a:0 "Find who is responsible!"

 france.21.t:0 "The Paris Commune"
 france.21.d:0 "A minor worker’s strike in Paris has erupted into open insurrection! Elements of various Jacobin paramilitary groups have seized control of the city’s industrial areas and declared themselves the “Paris Commune.” The would-be revolutionaries have already fortified their holdings, and local police are ill-equipped to handle the well armed militants. Similar communes have already begun to spring up throughout Eastern France. If we don’t end this, here and now, we may be on the receiving end of a full blown popular revolution."
 france.21.a:0 "Deploy the Army to break the Commune!"
 france.21.b:0 "Ask Thorez to negotiate with them"

 france.22.t:0 "Thorez negotiates peace"
 france.22.d:0 "Maurice Thorez has, somehow, managed to negotiate a peace deal with the Communards. The Paris Commune and the associated Communes will disband, and in return, the Communards have requested amnesty for any crimes they might have been accused of. For now, it seems, we have managed to avert the revolutionary crisis. For now."
 france.22.a:0 "Thank god for that damned Socialist"

 france.23.t:0 "Thorez is killed!"
 france.23.d:0 "Maurice Thorez, in his attempts to negotiate with the Communards, has been killed! Reports are sketchy, but police are telling us that Thorez was marched out to the barricade and subsequently shot by a revolutionary for “betraying the workers.” The news has spread quickly throughout the nation, and even more communes are starting to appear with increasing militancy. The Revolution, it seems, has only just begun."
 france.23.a:0 "Oh, come on."

 france.25.t:0 "Pétain opposes the Reform Plan"
 france.25.d:0 "Pétain and the National Salvation Front have announced their opposition to the new Radical Reform plan proposed by Thorez and the Popular Front. The aging General referred to the plan as “dangerously communist in nature” and that it “threatened the rights of French markets.”"
 france.25.a:0 "Maybe you should have won the election, then."

 france.26.t:0 "Labour Committee reports Factories over Efficiency!"
 france.26.d:0 "The Labour Committee established via the Radical Reform plan has reported that our factories are over efficiency thanks to the reforms instituted. This has given a temporary boost to our local industry!"
 france.26.a:0 "Fantastic!"

 france.27.t:0 "The Paris Imperial Conference"
 france.27.d:0 "As part of the reforms instituted by Thorez and the Popular Front, various representatives from around the French Empire have been invited to the first Paris Imperial Conference. Similar to the British conferences, the initial conference is convening to establish our plans for shifting the French colonies towards local autonomy, both for ideological and pragmatic reasons."
 france.27.a:0 "We should begin shifting our colonies towards local rule."

 france.28.t:0 "Restoring Order"
 france.28.d:0 "Despite our best attempts, the militancy of the NSF continues to grow. The situation has been helped little by Pétain’s campaign against the Radical Reform Plan and rumors that the military may harbor NSF sympathies. We need to conduct a major propaganda victory to show the public that we are still in control, and that means handling the NSF. Their headquarters in Bordeaux is a natural target, as we could disorganize them enough for further arrests. However, such a bold move might prove to our detriment. Simply having Pétain himself arrested in Vichy, where he is currently campaigning, is a less blatant move, but getting the old Lion under control might help convince his more radial supporters to stand down."
 france.28.a:0 "Order the army to march on Bordeaux and seize the NSF headquarters!"
 france.28.b:0 "Order the Police to arrest Pétain and his supporters in Vichy!"

 france.29.t:0 "Chaos in Bordeaux"
 france.29.d:0 "Sending the army into Bordeaux has backfired tremendously! NSF Militants were quick to assume defensive positions, having seemingly anticipated our move, likely having gained the information though sympathetic forces in the military. The attack was an utter failure, as members of the army have widely deserted to the NSF, which has swelled it’s ranks and accused the Thorez government of attempting to “destroy French democracy.” The Crisis deepens."
 france.29.a:0 "This is terrible!"

 france.30.t:0 "Pétain eludes capture in Vichy"
 france.30.d:0 "The police in Vichy were seemingly tipped off to our plans, and Pétain has eluded capture. Not only that, but he has gained a groundswell of public support. His supporters in the NSF have already begun distributing news of the attempt through underground channels, claiming that the Thorez government is illegitimate. The crisis deepens."
 france.30.a:0 "How did you lose one old man?!"

 france.31.t:0 "Operation Anton"
 france.31.d:0 "The Crisis has deepened beyond the point of return. With the NSF becoming openly militant against our government, we are forced to take drastic measures. Elements of the Jacobins, who are similarly militant against the NSF, have provided information on the General’s whereabouts and have offered their services in dealing with him. Such a move would galvanize public opinion against us, but might cut the head off the snake and allow us to divide and defeat the militant, radicalized NSF. How should we proceed?"
 france.31.a:0 "Give them the go ahead."
 france.31.b:0 "This is too much."

 france.32.t:0 "Pétain strikes back!"
 france.32.d:0 "The Plot has failed! Our agents were arrested, outed by elements of our own government. In the early morning hours, the military has staged a coup of the Thorez government to remove us from power! Pétain, speaking over the radio today, announced that he had “assumed control of the French government to protect the nation from the Bolshevik threat.” Thorez and the Jacobins have fled to their holdouts in Eastern France, and it seems the crisis is far from over."
 france.32.a:0 "The NSF assumes control."

 france.33.t:0 "The March on Paris"
 france.33.d:0 "Crisis once more! Pro-Pétain elements of the French army have staged a coup of the government, ousting us from power and forcing Thorez and the Popular Front to flee. Pétain, speaking over the radio, announced that “Thorez and his Bolshevik compatriots have been removed, and that he will see to it that France is purged of the threat of communist thought.” With the country only tangentially under the General’s control, it seems the crisis is far from over."
 france.33.a:0 "The NSF assumes control."

 france.34.t:0 "Nationwide Union Crackdown"
 france.34.d:0 "Throughout the nation, the Police and the NSF have begun moving to take down Union strikes. Much of the French industrial base in the East has been paralyzed by the economic crisis, and this has garnered support for the Conseil Syndical de France and the New Jacobins. Ultranationalist paramilitaries, with support from the police, have moved into to break the strikes and strongly dissuade individuals from joining Trade Unions or the Communist Party. Thorez and his compatriots seem to have re-doubled their efforts in the midst of this."
 france.34.a:0 "Down with the Reds!"

 france.35.t:0 "The Versailles Fire"
 france.35.d:0 "In the night, unidentified individuals have lit fire to the Versailles Palace! Though we were able evacuate the building and prevent any casualties, the attack has shaken our seat of government. The King-Regent has already been moved to a secure location, and authorities are quite literally left with the ashes of our government to pour over. In light of this, Prime Minister Pétain has announced that drastic actions must be taken to prevent the Jacobin threat from destroying the French nation."
 france.35.a:0 "Drastic action must be taken to protect France!"

 france.36.t:0 "The Estates-General is Suspended"
 france.36.d:0 "Speaking before the gathered delegates in the temporary capital at Bordeaux, Marshall Pétain announced his intention to permanently suspend the Estates-General until such time as the crisis is resolved. Maurice Thorez and the Popular Front, along with many other leftists, dramatically walked from the government immediately after, marking a decided split between the left and right in France. Backed by the military, Pétain’s plans are nebulous, but it seems likely that despite his promises, the crisis is far from over."
 france.36.a:0 "Democracy is but a barrier to fighting the red menace!"

 france.37.t:0 "Jacobin Terror Bombing"
 france.37.d:0 "Jacobin paramilitaries, armed with stolen weapons, have launched a raid in the nation. They have successfully attacked and damaged one of our industrial factories!"
 france.37.a:0 "This is terrible!"

 france.38.t:0 "No Clear winner in the Elections"
 france.38.d:0 "No clear winner has been found in the Provincial elections! Without a clear victor, the Estates-General must vote to decide who must assume control of the new government. Such an event is largely unprecedented in modern French history, save for minor crises during previous administrations. With the new emergency vote, the elected officials in Paris must now decide who will assume power in the Estates-General."
 france.38.a:0 "The Estates-General votes for Blum"
 france.38.b:0 "The Estates-General votes for Pétain"
 france.38.c:0 "The Estates-General votes for Thorez"

 france.39.t:0 "Suffragette March in Paris"
 france.39.d:0 "A major march for women’s suffrage was conducted in the capital in Paris today. Women’s voting rights have been a hotly contested issue in the Empire since the Great War, with arguments from traditionalists and reformists. The suffragettes were largely peaceful, though some minor confrontations were broken up by the local police."
 france.39.a:0 "What nonsense."
 france.39.b:0 "Perhaps something worth looking in to?"

 france.40.t:0 "The Economy is in shambles"
 france.40.d:0 "The global economic crisis has deepened once more. With millions out of work, the demand for labour has dropped dramatically due to decreased business. Wages have thus dropped across the entire board and investor confidence has become practically nonexistent. Even in urban centers like Paris, homelessness and mass evictions have become a serious issue. We need to try and employ some kind of immediate measures to stabilize things."
 france.40.a:0 "The market will save us!"
 france.40.b:0 "Increase tariffs to encourage domestic spending"
 france.40.c:0 "Abandon the Gold Standard and pump money into the economy!"

 france.41.t:0 "Expelling the Undesirables"
 france.41.d:0 "As part of the reforms of the new French State, the new Grand Leader Jacques Doriot has commanded that all those who would oppose the new France be expelled from the nation. Among these include monarchists, sexual deviants and those deemed undesirable by the Doriot government. Several thousand people have been expelled across the border into the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland and beyond, while having their assets seized to serve the new state."
 france.41.a:0 "Only the purest for France!"

 france.42.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Elections"
 france.42.d:0 "With democracy finally restored in France, the Estates-General is set to re-assume powers in the provisional capital of Bordeaux until Paris is determined to be both safe and reconstructed enough to return to. For now, a small emergency election is to be held to determine who will assume the majority government in the Estates."
 france.42.a:0 "Parti Radical"
 france.42.b:0 "Parti républicain"
 france.42.c:0 "The FSN Moderates"

 france.43.t:0 "King Alfonso arrives in Bordeaux"
 france.43.d:0 "Crowds gathered outside the King’s provisional residence today in Bordeaux. Alfonso XIII, King of France and Spain, arrived to speak before provisional Estates-General. King Alfonso stated his intention to assist the Frenchmen of the Dual Empires, and that he would be staying in Bordeaux for the next few weeks to assist the new government in securing legitimacy. Additionally, a month long tour of the former Nationalist French territories to “improve morale” has been suggested, though quickly shot down due to security concerns."
 france.43.a:0 "Finally, some peace and quiet."

 france.44.t:0 "The Army refuses to Attack!"
 france.44.d:0 "Despite clear orders to move in and begin securing Paris, the Imperial Army has refused to open fire on the Parisians! Several major commanders within the Imperial Army stated, in a report to the Imperial authorities, that they refuse to open fire on fellow Frenchmen. Additionally, several of these commanders have since either resigned or joined up with the Communards!"
 france.44.a:0 "Oh."

 france.45.t:0 "Army Defections Continue"
 france.45.d:0 "Mass army defections have become systemic throughout the country! In dozens, if not hundreds of army bases, small scale civil wars have begun breaking out among the soldiery. The whole of the army appears to be fighting with itself, with thousands defecting to Communes that have begun to spring up throughout Eastern France."
 france.45.a:0 "Shit."

 france.46.t:0 "Marcel Déat declares a People's War"
 france.46.d:0 "In a stirring speech before the so-called “Dunkirk Commune”, Jacobin leader Marcel Déat declared a “people’s war” against the “tyrannical imperialist government.” Déat’s move has been widely welcomed by many radical communist Frenchmen, who have been itching for any excuse to go after the French government since the economic crash of the early 30s. \n\n Already, Déat-aligned “revolutionary guards” have begun raiding government depots and assassinating officials throughout areas of the country that are controlled by the Communards."
 france.46.a:0 "Can't we just talk about this."

 # IMPERIAL FRANCE EVENTS - EXTERNAL
 ###################################
 france_external.1.t:0 "Instability in France"
 france_external.1.d:0 "Distressing reports have been coming in of growing instability in France. It seems the economic crisis that has hit the British is affecting them just as badly, if not worse. Radicals like the Salvation Front and the Jacobins seem poised to finally gain power in our sister nation. It has been suggested that His Majesty’s government pen a letter to Paris voicing our concerns, perhaps with the hope that we can politely suggest our friends get their affairs in order."
 france_external.1.a:0 "Voice our concerns to Paris"
 france_external.1.b:0 "Keep quiet on French affairs"

 france_external.2.t:0 "His Majesty voices his concerns."
 france_external.2.d:0 "Word has come in from Madrid. His Majesty, King-Emperor Alfonso, has made it clear that he has grave concerns over the instability in France. Radicalism, he says, cannot be allowed to ferment within the Bourbon empire. While it is clear his letter references the recent growing support for the socialists and Jacobins, some in the government have interpreted it as supporting a continuation of the Blum government. Regardless, we should tread carefully going forward."
 france_external.2.a:0 "We're fine. Everything. is. fine."

 france_external.3.t:0 "France seeks a detente"
 france_external.3.d:0 "Word has come in from Madrid. His Majesty, King-Emperor Alfonso, has made it clear that he has grave concerns over the instability in France. Radicalism, he says, cannot be allowed to ferment within the Bourbon empire. While it is clear his letter references the recent growing support for the socialists and Jacobins, some in the government have interpreted it as supporting a continuation of the Blum government. Regardless, we should tread carefully going forward."
 france_external.3.a:0 "Perhaps this imperial rivalry has gotten out of hand."

 france_external.4.t:0 "The Rhineland Situation"
 france_external.4.d:0 "When Germany exploded into Civil War, our forces marched into the Rhineland to occupy it and ensure that, even while Germany was in ruins, that war reparations could continue. This action has garnered us major international disdain, both from the other European nations and the increasingly militant German factions. With the Rhenish occupation sucking away vital resources, it might be a good time to either cut them loose or shift towards a more hands-off approach."
 france_external.4.a:0 "End the Occuation entirely. They're on their own."
 france_external.4.b:0 "End the Occupation, but keep them in our sphere of influence."
 france_external.4.c:0 "We will not cave to pressure!"

 france_external.5.t:0 "France ends the Rhineland Occupation!"
 france_external.5.d:0 "Today, the French government has announced to the Rhenish parliament that they will be formally ending their occupation of the Rhineland and will be handing military matters over to the Republic. This is a major victory for our independence from the French, who have maintained an occupation on our nation and prevented our development since the intervention in the German Civil War."
 france_external.5.a:0 "Free, at last. Finally."

 france_external.6.t:0 "France maintains the Rhenish Occupation"
 france_external.6.d:0 "France has announced to the Rhenish parliament that they will be maintaining their occupation of the Rhenish Republic for “as long as deemed necessary.” This has incensed German nationalists, who are calling for open rebellion against the “French imperialists.” It seems our freedom from France is still quite a ways away. For now."
 france_external.6.a:0 "This is why no one likes the French."

 france_external.7.t:0 "France seeks more formal relations"
 france_external.7.d:0 "Our nation has, for many years, maintained neutrality while leaning towards the French. The fact that Libya was never colonized or conquered by now is a miracle, occurring only via playing the British and the French off one another. Now, however, the French are seeking to expand their influence in Libya and shift us from being a nominal puppet to being fully aligned to the French Empire. This would effectively destroy Libya’s sovereignty, but would give us protection from outside attack."
 france_external.7.a:0 "Agree to their terms."
 france_external.7.b:0 "We will not be slaves to Paris!"

 france_external.8.t:0 "Libya has refused our terms!"
 france_external.8.d:0 "The Libyan government has refused our terms requesting a formalization of our diplomatic ties. This could mean a myriad of things, but warhawks in the government fear that they may be considering defecting to the British."
 france_external.8.a:0 "Then we'll take them by force."
 france_external.8.b:0 "We'll leave them be, then."

 france_external.9.t:0 "Re-Evaluating French Indochina"
 france_external.9.d:0 "French Indochina is one of several outposts in the Far East, and has been maintained by the French government since the late 1800s. In recent years, however, calls for greater home rule have increased in intensity, and our ability to counteract insurgent independence movements has waned. In light of this, a total re-examination of our policy towards Indochina is necessary. More radical plans push to break up the inefficient colony into smaller client states, while a more conservative plan indicates we should allow the creation of a localized Indochinese parliament."
 france_external.9.a:0 "Split the colony up into more easily administrated colonies."
 france_external.9.b:0 "Allow for Indochinese home rule."
 france_external.9.c:0 "Stay the course. Status Quo."

 france_external.10.t:0 "Orders from Paris"
 france_external.10.d:0 "New dictates have arrived from Paris. The Indochina colony is to be, effective immediately, split up into its constituent nations as client states to France. Our administrators will be split between the various nations to assist in the transitional process where needed."
 france_external.10.a:0 "Duly noted. (Change to Vietnam)"
 france_external.10.b:0 "Orders? What orders?"

 france_external.11.t:0 "Orders from Paris"
 france_external.11.d:0 "New dictates have arrived from Paris. The Indochina colony is to, effective immediately, begin handing over local power to native authorities. Two possible camps can be empowered via this decree. Either the monarchists, headed by Vietnamese leader Bao Dai, or the Republicans lead by the leader of the Vietnamese National Committee, Ngo Dinh Diem. Both men have a particular vision for the region, governed either by traditionalist or secularist principles."
 france_external.11.a:0 "Empower Emperor Bao Dai of Vietnam"
 france_external.11.b:0 "Enlist Republican Leader Ngo Dinh Diem"
 france_external.11.c:0 "Why are we listening to Paris?"

 france_external.12.t:0 "Funds from the Colonial Development Programme"
 france_external.12.d:0 "Back in Paris, the government has approved a large scale colonial development scheme to help us improve our infrastructure and civilian economies. The funds from this scheme will greatly help us build up the nation."
 france_external.12.a:0 "Excellent."

 france_external.13.t:0 "The Future of Wallonia"
 france_external.13.d:0 "The region of Wallonia, seized during the failed Belgian Revolution, has been a part of France for more than a century. However, the melting pot of German, Dutch and French culture has lead to a unique cultural and linguistic identity for the peoples of the region. Since the Great War, there have been small, yet vocal, calls for Wallonian self administration or even outright independence. Given our potentially vulnerable border with Free Germany, it might be prudent to create a small buffer state between ourselves and them, just in case."
 france_external.13.a:0 "Allow the Walloon Council to draft a constitution"
 france_external.13.b:0 "Create a loyal Wallonian puppet state"
 france_external.13.c:0 "Make some token reforms, but nothing too drastic"

 france_external.14.t:0 "The Concept of Franco-Iberia"
 france_external.14.d:0 "A concept proposed during the late 1800s, Franco-Iberia was a proposed unification between Bourbon France and Spain to create a greater dynastic empire in Western Europe. The proposal had never been seriously considered until recently, but given the growing threat of a resurgent Germany and conflicts around the world, it might be wise to consider such a drastic concept."
 france_external.14.a:0 "Let's see what Madrid thinks."
 france_external.14.b:0 "This is hogwash."

 france_external.15.t:0 "France proposes a union"
 france_external.15.d:0 "France has come to us with a proposal. Dusting off the old conceptualization of Franco-Iberia, Paris has proposed that we formalize the Dual Monarchy under a fully integrated dynastic state. In effect, this would mean the total unification of France and Spain under a united state. Such an effort is a massive undertaking, and approving it would be a major drain on our resources until such time as the plans are formalized."
 france_external.15.a:0 "An Excellent idea!"
 france_external.15.b:0 "Nonsense. Utter nonsense."

 france_external.16.t:0 "Spain agrees!"
 france_external.16.d:0 "Spain has agreed to the act of union. Our two nations will begin the grand undertaking to formalize the Franco-Iberian proposal and begin uniting our two administrations."
 france_external.16.a:0 "Excellent!"

 france_external.17.t:0 "Spain refuses."
 france_external.17.d:0 "Spain has refused our proposal to formalize the Franco-Iberian Proposal."
 france_external.17.a:0 "Unfortunate."

 france_external.18.t:0 "Our Policy in the Middle East"
 france_external.18.d:0 "Though the Middle East has largely been dominated by British interests since the Great War, we have tacitly encouraged the Sauds in their attempts to unite the Arabian peninsula. This has largely been a cynical measure, as the Hashemites have seen notable support from the British Empire. Continuing to support the Saudis might further enflame tensions between the two Arab factions, but with our support they may be able to take down the Hashemites."
 france_external.18.a:0 "Support the Hashemites"
 france_external.18.b:0 "Support the Saudis"
 france_external.18.c:0 "Take no stance."

 france_external.19.t:0 "The Madras Proposal"
 france_external.19.d:0 "Our colony in India has been a source of both monetary gain and consternation. Though exports from the region have helped the economy greatly, the constant protests and insurgencies by the local Indians has made it, somewhat paradoxically, also a money sink. To the North is the Republic of Bihar, and to the East of them, the British colonies. Sharing a mutual enemy, it has been proposed that we instead offer French India to the Republic in exchange for a diplomatic alliance, further securing our interests on the Indian subcontinent."
 france_external.19.a:0 "Offer the region to Bihar"
 france_external.19.b:0 "We have no interest in this arrangement."

 france_external.20.t:0 "A proposal from Paris"
 france_external.20.d:0 "Since the Indian War of Independence, the Southern region of Madras has been controlled by the French Empire. Their policy towards the local Indian population has largely been either repressive or violent. Now, however, we’ve received a proposal from the French that they are willing to turn over control of the region in exchange for a diplomatic alliance."
 france_external.20.a:0 "Better the devil you know."
 france_external.20.b:0 "We don't make deals with imperialists."

 france_external.21.t:0 "Bihar has agreed to our proposal!"
 france_external.21.d:0 "Bihar has agreed to our arrangement!"
 france_external.21.a:0 "Excellent."

 france_external.22.t:0 "Bihar has refused our proposal."
 france_external.22.d:0 "Bihar has refused our proposal."
 france_external.22.a:0 "Unfortunate."

 france_external.23.t:0 "Ratifying the Madras Proposal"
 france_external.23.d:0 "As per the agreement of the Madras Proposal, French India is to officially hand over control of the administration over to officials from the Republic of Bihar and leave the region for reassignment. New administrators, officials and military forces are already working on integrating the new provinces into the Republic."
 france_external.23.a:0 "Ratify the Proposal"
 france_external.23.b:0 "Refuse."

 france_external.24.t:0 "The Declaration of Franco-Iberia"
 france_external.24.d:0 "Over the last year, both Spain and France have worked tirelessly to create a united administration for the creation of a united Franco-Iberian state. Finally, today, that dream has come to fruition. All that is left now is to set things in motion and begin the process of integration."
 france_external.24.a:0 "Further beyond, friends!"

 france_external.25.t:0 "The Declaration of Franco-Iberia"
 france_external.25.d:0 "Over the last year, both Spain and France have worked tirelessly to create a united administration for the creation of a united Franco-Iberian state. Finally, today, that dream has come to fruition. All that is left now is to set things in motion and begin the process of integration."
 france_external.25.a:0 "A toast to our Parisian brothers!"

 france_external.26.t:0 "France seeks to renew the Entente"
 france_external.26.d:0 "As part of an ongoing diplomatic mission, France has sent diplomats to Holland to seek an alliance with the Netherlands. Holland, previously forced into cooperation with the French due to the mutual threat of Germany, could benefit greatly from French protection given the potential for further hostilities with Germany or the Central Powers."
 france_external.26.a:0 "A worthwhile endeavor!"
 france_external.26.b:0 "A pointless gesture."

 france_external.27.t:0 "France seeks to renew the Entente"
 france_external.27.d:0 "As part of an ongoing diplomatic mission, France has sent diplomats to Lisbon to seek our assistance in expanding the Entente as a force for peace on the continent. Though our nation has long maintained close ties to the British, given the state of affairs in Europe, it might be wise to find better friends."
 france_external.27.a:0 "A worthwhile endeavor!"
 france_external.27.b:0 "A pointless gesture."

 france_external.28.t:0 "The London Paris-Axis"
 france_external.28.d:0 "France has made a rather shocking diplomatic gesture. Noting the threat of hostilities beginning once more between the French people and a resurgent Central Powers, diplomats from France have arrived to appeal for the renewal of the alliance our two nations shared during the Great War. Our rivalry with the French has been going on for more than a century now, and some old traditionalists are unwilling to bury the hatchet. Even still, leaving France to its fate could leave us without strong footing on the European continent, and open us up to pressure from whomever asserts dominance."
 france_external.28.a:0 "Mutual defense might be our best bet."
 france_external.28.b:0 "Paris can burn for all we care."

 france_external.29.t:0 "Britain refuses!"
 france_external.29.d:0 "Britain has refused our offer of an alliance!"
 france_external.29.a:0 "Damn it all!"

 french_revolution.1.d:0 "As the country descends into anarchy, communist revolutionaries have allied under the Jacobins against our government! Declaring themselves as the French Republic, the revolutionaries intend to seize control of the nation and end the monarchy permanently. Already, communard militias have assumed control of Eastern France and forced us from the capital. The King-Regent and the government have fled to Bordeaux, and must now attempt to regain control of the country."

 french_revolution.1.b:0 "We will stand with the Revolution! (PLAY AS RFA)"

 french_revolution.2.t:0 "Wallonia declares Independence"
 french_revolution.2.d:0 "Fearing the communist revolution in the East, and backed by the Dutch government, the autonomous parliament of Wallonia has declared their independence from the French Empire. Already, Dutch troops have moved into the region to protect the new Wallonian government, and keep it from falling into the hands of the Jacobin revolutionaries."
 french_revolution.2.a:0 "Let them go."
 french_revolution.2.b:0 "For independence, comrades!"

 french_revolution.3.t:0 "The Rhineland is unprotected!"
 french_revolution.3.d:0 "France is in chaos. In the midst of this, the Rhenish Demilitarized State has been cut loose and is finally unprotected. We can now begin the process of reunifying Germany under the people’s revolution!"
 french_revolution.3.a:0 "Let us end it, then."

 french_revolution.4.t:0 "The Rhineland is unprotected!"
 french_revolution.4.d:0 "France is in chaos. In the midst of this, the Rhenish Demilitarized State has been cut loose and is finally unprotected. We can now begin the process of reunifying Germany under the people’s revolution!"
 french_revolution.4.a:0 "Let us end it, then."

 french_revolution.5.t:0 "France in anarchy"
 french_revolution.5.d:0 "Across the Mediterranean, France has erupted into chaos. Communist revolutionaries have taken up arms against the ruling government, and opportunistic nations have already begun seizing territory. With the homeland in free fall, we are now left to our own devices to try and maintain the French African territories until such time as order is restored back home. Hopefully."
 french_revolution.5.a:0 "We're on our own for now."

 french_revolution.6.t:0 "Mass Anti-French Demonstrations"
 french_revolution.6.d:0 "Word has spread quickly that France is in chaos, and across Algeria, thousands have risen up to protest the French colony. Communists, socialists, republicans and the like have banded together against our control over Algeria. A list of demands requesting the official end of French rule has been submitted by the newly formed “Algerian National Congress”, lead by nationalist leader Ferhat Abbas. We must decide how to handle the crisis."
 french_revolution.6.a:0 "Send out the Colonial Force to disperse the demonstrations!"
 french_revolution.6.b:0 "We don't have enough resources for a showdown right now. Let them shout."

 french_revolution.7.t:0 "Revolution in France"
 french_revolution.7.d:0 "Revolution has erupted in France against the Imperial government, and we are now forced to decide how to proceed. Shall we maintain our diplomatic ties to France and intervene to end the war, or should we try to save our own skins? Cowardly, yes, but it may keep Spain safe from the communists for now."
 french_revolution.7.a:0 "Leave them to their fate."
 french_revolution.7.b:0 "We stand by the French!"

 french_revolution.8.t:0 "Spain has abandoned us!"
 french_revolution.8.d:0 "The Spanish have abandoned us to fight the Communists alone! We must now devote all resources to combatting the Jacobin threat, which means that we can no longer protect the empire. We have to cut them loose, if we intend to protect what we already have at home. Let us hope that the empire still exists when we re-assert control over the mainland."
 french_revolution.8.a:0 "We can no longer protect our empire."

 french_revolution.9.t:0 "The Revolution begins"
 french_revolution.9.d:0 "France has already been torn apart, even with just low-level fighting. It is time to end this revolution, and restore France to her former glory!"
 french_revolution.9.a:0 "We'll be ready for these schoolboys."

 french_revolution.10.t:0 "Reactionary Coup!"
 french_revolution.10.d:0 "As France descends into chaos, a cadre of military officers aligned to Field Marshal Pétain have marched on our provisional capital in Bordeaux to seize control of the state! With little time to react and our forces elsewhere, the remainder of the government not in Communard hands has been detained. Security forces are already en route from elsewhere to try and change the tide of the coup, but it remains to be seen whether or not they will arrive in time."
 french_revolution.10.a:0 "They had their chance."
 french_revolution.10.b:0 "The Coup fails! Chaos Ensues"

 french_revolution.11.t:0 "The Fate of the King-Regent"
 french_revolution.11.d:0 "A report from the front! Communard militias captured the King-Regent attempting to escape the Republic for the reactionaries in the West. The King-Regent, Alphonse, along with much of his family, are in our custody near the front line awaiting their fate. Naturally the Jacobin bloc, having gained a minority in the Directory, wants to have the King-Regent and his family executed, effectively severing all ties with the Bourbon dynasty and ending any chance of a cordial resolution to the revolution. Killing the king, however, will likely galvanize public opinion and foreign opinions against us."
 french_revolution.11.a:0 "Execute him in the Capital Square!"
 french_revolution.11.b:0 "Leave him be for now. He's no threat."

 french_revolution.12.t:0 "Revolutionaries publicly execute the King-Regent!"
 french_revolution.12.d:0 "After an aborted attempt to flee his estate in Eastern France, the King-Regent Alphonse was captured by revolutionary militias. Not but a few days later, the King-Regent and his family were publicly hung in the former Capital square! The killings, including the King-Regent’s wife and servants, has galvanized public opinion against the Communards!"
 french_revolution.12.a:0 "They'll pay for that!"

 french_revolution.13.t:0 "The Algerian Revolution"
 french_revolution.13.d:0 "Our attempts to keep the colony pacified have failed. The Algerian National Congress has voted to unilaterally declare independence from the French Empire, and organized militias have begun to march into Algiers. Though we’ve been able to keep the capital and the region around it under our control for now, the French garrison in the South has seen fit to assume control directly there under a temporary military governate under Edgard de Larminat, one of the former colonial security force commanders. For the time being, we’re on our own against the Revolutionaries."
 french_revolution.13.a:0 "Stand for France! (Remain as French Africa)"
 french_revolution.13.b:0 "Algeria seizes total control! (Play as Algeria)"
 french_revolution.13.c:0 "Join the long march south (Play as French Northwest Africa)"

 french_revolution.14.t:0 "The War for Algiers"
 french_revolution.14.d:0 "The cowardly French colonialists have fled to their hovels in Algiers, fearful of the people’s revolution! Thousands of Pieds Noirs have fled to the so-called Algerian Governate, fearing reprisals from militias. As the provisional government begins to be formed, we must quickly crush the remnants of the French colonialists and fully liberate the free Algerian nation. Onwards, comrades, to Algiers!"
 french_revolution.14.a:0 "Down with the French!"

 french_revolution.15.t:0 "The Southern Retreat"
 french_revolution.15.d:0 "The retreat to sub-saharan Africa has wrought havoc on the colonial security force. After mere days of falling back on foot, train and bicycle, our meager force is tired and decimated. At least one in ten of our soldiers has died along the way from a myriad of causes. Even then, we already face problems with securing our position. It seems that word of the Algerian revolution, as well as the conflict at home, as spread quickly. Already, a myriad of revolutionary movements are beginning to sprout up. We need to try and pacify the Sub-saharan colonies before we can even consider retaking the North."
 french_revolution.15.a:0 "No rest for the wicked, then."

 french_revolution.16.t:0 "French Africa is in chaos"
 french_revolution.16.d:0 "Sparked by the chaos across our own border in France, the French African colonies have fractured. A full blown revolution is in sway in Algeria, while the majority of their colonial forces have retreated to the South to fortify their positions. In France’s time of trial, perhaps we can forgo concepts of Imperial brotherhood in lieu of seizing vital territories from the collapsing French colonies?"
 french_revolution.16.a:0 "Grab what we can, while we can."
 french_revolution.16.b:0 "We won't steal from our French comrades."

 french_revolution.17.t:0 "The Guinea Coast Revolts!"
 french_revolution.17.d:0 "With the revolutionary fervor sweeping the African continent, our already shaky regime has been challenged by popular revolts on the Guinea coast. The Islamic Emirate of Baule, lead by Samori Toure has risen up to challenge us for control of the region, while a coalition of Fula peoples have staged open rebellion in their respective regions. We have to put these revolts down if we intend to maintain our position."
 french_revolution.17.a:0 "A final showdown it is, then."

 french_revolution.18.t:0 "Central Africa Revolts!"
 french_revolution.18.d:0 "Revolutionary forces have already begun to mobilize in the dark heart of Central Africa. While our forces have been occupied fighting one revolt, yet another has already begun! The Republics of Sokoto and Ubangi-Shari have risen up, executing local French colonial authorities and marching against us! We must contain this mindless violence!"
 french_revolution.18.a:0 "We're being stretched too thin!"

 french_revolution.19.t:0 "Pro-Indian Coup!"
 french_revolution.19.d:0 "The home country has been thrown into chaos and, with it, our colonial government. Local branches of the Indian National Congress have already stepped up their efforts to try and remove the French from the continent, and now a coalition of armed Pro-Indian militants have attempted to seize control of the government under the banner of local INC leader O. P. Ramaswamy Reddiya. "
 french_revolution.19.a:0 "The Coup succeeds!"
 french_revolution.19.b:0 "The Coup fails."

 french_revolution.20.t:0 "Pro-Indian Coup in Madras"
 french_revolution.20.d:0 "To the south of our border, the Indian peoples have overthrown their colonial oppressors and seized control! Declaring the new state of Madras, O. P. Ramaswamy Reddiyar, a local INC representative, has set forth on reforming the new state and “de-francifying” the colony. Several Pan-Indianist elements of our government have proposed that we seek a union with the new Madras state, further strengthening us against the revanchist British in the East."
 french_revolution.20.a:0 "Propose a union with the new nation"
 french_revolution.20.b:0 "Madras is of no concern to us."

 french_revolution.21.t:0 "Bihar proposes a union"
 french_revolution.21.d:0 "The Republic of Bihar to our North, one of the many nations to spring from the Indian Revolution, has proposed a union between our two nations. Madras would retain her autonomy, while largely relegating foreign policy to Bihar. In this, we would be able to operate as we so desire while also affording us some level of protection against the perfidious European powers."
 french_revolution.21.a:0 "An excellent idea."
 french_revolution.21.b:0 "We have no interest in this right now."

 french_revolution.22.t:0 "Madras agrees!"
 french_revolution.22.d:0 "Madras has agreed to our proposal of a union!"
 french_revolution.22.a:0 "Excellent!"

 french_revolution.23.t:0 "Madras refuses"
 french_revolution.23.d:0 "Madras has refused our proposal of a union!"
 french_revolution.23.a:0 "We'll leave it at that, then."
 french_revolution.23.b:0 "Take them by force!"

 french_revolution.24.t:0 "The Saigon government collapses!"
 french_revolution.24.d:0 "Cut off from supplies from France proper, our authority over the colony has eroded almost immediately. Nationalist, communist and even monarchist movements have begun seizing control of the region. The Saigon government has fled South to British Malaya, leaving many of the new Indochinese governments to their own devices."
 french_revolution.24.a:0 "Emperor Bao Dai takes control in the chaos. (Play as Vietnam)"

 french_revolution.25.t:0 "The Saigon government arrives"
 french_revolution.25.d:0 "Disturbing reports have come in of the total collapse of the French government in Indochina. Many of the constituent kingdoms of the region have declared independence, and now fight among each other and against outside forces to maintain that independence. Just this morning, the battered and beleaguered elements of the former Saigon government have arrived in the port at Singapore, requesting asylum. We’ve opted to settle them into a few of the local security force barracks, but many advisors feel that this may just be the calm before the storm."
 french_revolution.25.a:0 "Christ, this is bad."

 french_revolution.26.t:0 "French Indochina falls!"
 french_revolution.26.d:0 "The colony of French Indochina has collapsed entirely, virtually overnight. With the new kingdoms of Laos and Khmer attempting to secure themselves, our generals have suggested that we attempt to seize these constituent nations. They dream of a Greater Siam, and with these new nations relatively weak, we should have an easy time seizing control of them."
 french_revolution.26.a:0 "March the Royal Army against them! For Greater Siam!"
 french_revolution.26.b:0 "We have no interest in conquest."

 french_revolution.27.t:0 "Power struggles in the Front!"
 french_revolution.27.d:0 "The Front was, at least initially, united in their alliance against the Communist threat. Now, however, with the fate of France in their hands, more reactionary elements of the party have begun to make their move. Jacques Doriot, head of the far-right Ultranationalist faction, has mobilized his small militant faction to try and unseat Pétain as head of the current junta and, by extension, head of the remaining French government. Similarly, Marcel Bucard’s Integralist faction has begun making similar moves to try and seize power during the chaos, backed by their own miltias."
 french_revolution.27.a:0 "Pétain retains his power."
 french_revolution.27.b:0 "Doriot overthrows Pétain"
 french_revolution.27.c:0 "Bucard overthrows them both."

 french_revolution.28.t:0 "The British Embassy in Paris"
 french_revolution.28.d:0 "With Paris under our control, the Directory has turned its attention on the British Embassy. The British ambassadors were unable to evacuate the city before it came under our control, and thus we must decide their fate. Party hardliners believe that the imperialists must be tried and executed, just as any other counter-revolutionary, while pragmatists fear that this might incite a response from the British."
 french_revolution.28.a:0 "Allow them to evacuate."
 french_revolution.28.b:0 "Have the imperialists arrested and purged!"

 french_revolution.29.t:0 "British Ambassadors executed in France!"
 french_revolution.29.d:0 "Our ambassadors in France have been arrested and executed! Having failed to evacuate Paris as instructed, the ambassadors were captured, tried and executed by the so-called Directory of the French Republic. If we let such an event slide, we risk being seen as weak on the international stage! Even still, a full-scale intervention in France may be a major undertaking..."
 french_revolution.29.a:0 "This has gone too far."
 french_revolution.29.b:0 "Stand down. For now."

 french_revolution.30.t:0 "Nationalist Terror"
 french_revolution.30.d:0 "As the conflict between Frenchmen intensifies, overzealous troops have massacred a group of civilians and caused major damage to our reputation with the civilian population."
 french_revolution.30.a:0 "What a shame."

 french_revolution.31.t:0 "Revolutionary Terror"
 french_revolution.31.d:0 "As the conflict between Frenchmen intensifies, overzealous troops have massacred a group of civilians and caused major damage to our reputation with the civilian population."
 french_revolution.31.a:0 "All in the name of revolution, right comrades?"

 french_revolution.32.t:0 "The Liberation of Paris"
 french_revolution.32.d:0 "Nationalist forces have finally reclaimed Paris for the French government, but at terrible cost. The city is in utter ruins, with the Eiffel Tower itself obliterated by bombing raids. Those left in the city could only watch in shell-shocked silence as the Nationalist troops marched to secure the city’s various sectors. Speaking before a small gathered crowd, [Root.GetLeader] announced that “Here, where the terror of the Bolsheviks began, and here it ends.” Though the liberation of Paris came as a relief for many, for many more, it is only the beginning of the end for the French Communards."
 french_revolution.32.a:0 "How terrible."

 french_revolution.33.t:0 "The Fall of Bordeaux"
 french_revolution.33.d:0 "Revolutionary forces have finally taken control of the Nationalist capital at Bordeaux. Intense streetfighting has left much of the city in ruins, with those civilians left behind scrambling to avoid the conflict. The cabinet of the Imperial government has largely been apprehended, sans their most prominent leadership, who have mostly fled the country. Those left behind are already being shipped off for a trial before the Directory in Paris. A great blow has been dealt to the Nationalists, and now we must simply work to secure what remains of the country."
 french_revolution.33.a:0 "Yet another victory for the Revolution!"

 french_revolution.34.t:0 "Victory against the Communards"
 french_revolution.34.d:0 "France has, finally, been liberated from the Communist threat. While the would-be revolutionaries flee across the borders to Germany and beyond, we must now begin the process of rebuilding. Widows and mothers alike bury their sons as a new France arises from the ashes of the old."
 french_revolution.34.a:0 "Now, we rebuild and prepare for the next battle."

 french_revolution.35.t:0 "Victory against the Imperialists"
 french_revolution.35.d:0 "A new France is born today. As the reactionaries flee the country for abroad, the Directory and the Party now stand tall atop the corpse of the old imperialist France. Mothers and widows bury their sons as the revolutionaries begin the process of piecing their discordance into a new, better, more harmonious republic."
 french_revolution.35.a:0 "Now, we rest and prepare for the next battle."

 french_revolution.36.t:0 "The Future of France"
 french_revolution.36.d:0 "With France now secured, the Party must now turn their attentions to the future of French politics. The NSF’s acquisition of power has lead to an erosion of French democracy, and the fate of the monarchy is not assured. While the Grand Marshall would like to see the Monarchy, and perhaps even democracy, restored, other elements of the party are not sold on the prospect of ever returning to the tumultuous democracy that created the crisis to begin with."
 french_revolution.36.a:0 "Restore the Bourbon Monarch"
 french_revolution.36.b:0 "No more Kings. We need a new Republic."

 french_revolution.37.t:0 "The Future of the Estates-General"
 french_revolution.37.d:0 "Now that the monarchy has been properly restored, we must turn our attentions to the future of democracy in France. Though Paris is in ruins, there are many moderate conservatives and non-communard liberals in the provisional capital of Bordeaux calling for the resumption of the pre-war status quo."
 french_revolution.37.a:0 "Allow for the restoration of Democracy"
 french_revolution.37.b:0 "Disband the Estates-General, permanently."

 french_revolution.38.t:0 "The Bordeaux Decree"
 french_revolution.38.d:0 "Acting from the provisional capital in Bordeaux, Front leader Doriot has announced his “Bordeaux Decree.” The Decree is a series of lists of known potential communist dissidents, including many members of the former Radical Party. Doriot has ordered that all those known to be associated or suspected to be associated with the Communists be arrested and purged. Already, a small army of Blackshirt paramilitaries have begun moving through Bordeaux proper and begun executing any suspected communists."
 french_revolution.38.a:0 "Democracy was overrated anyway."

 french_revolution.39.t:0 "The Doriot Purges"
 french_revolution.39.d:0 "Concerns raised within the Front of Doriot’s plans have proven quite founded in reality. Early this morning, Doriot expanded his purges to include high-ranking members of the Front itself. Pétain and Bucard have since been arrested by the Blackshirts, and will be dealt with appropriately. Hundreds of die-hards for either man have similarly been arrested and put on trial. Doriot’s grasp on France grows tighter by the day."
 french_revolution.39.a:0 "Out with the old, in with the New."

 french_revolution.40.t:0 "France in Chaos"
 french_revolution.40.d:0 "France is in the grip of a deathly civil war, just miles away from the English coast. While warhawks debate our policy on the continent, more cynical matters have come to the table. There are many French colonies of interest to the Empire, and advisors have drafted plans for “Operation Maine.” \n\n The Operation, conducting over three days, would have British forces launch lighting operations to seize control of vital French ports in the Caribbean and beyond. Coordinated with CANDAM, the operation is estimated to be a success, as our networks in the Empire indicate that most of the garrisons have either been recalled home or gone rogue entirely in the chaos. We have an excellent opportunity to further calcify our naval hegemony."
 french_revolution.40.a:0 "Begin preparations for Operation Maine"
 french_revolution.40.b:0 "It's too risky right now."

 french_revolution.41.t:0 "British forces seize our Colonies!"
 french_revolution.41.d:0 "With our backs to the wall, the perfidious British have seized on the opportunity to seize and occupy several key French ports and minor colonies. The Operation was a rousing success, as our garrisons in these regions were completely unprepared and largely surrendered, much to the chagrin of our government. \n\n Such an action would normally be seen as an act of war, but given the circumstances, but we really don’t have much footing for a showdown with the British right now."
 french_revolution.41.a:0 "We can't afford a war like that right now."
 french_revolution.41.b:0 "Civil War or not, that's our territory!"

 french_revolution.42.t:0 "Pétain declares Free France"
 french_revolution.42.d:0 "Having evaded the Revolutionary Guards and worked with sympathizers in the South, Pétain and a cadre of his supporters have fled to Corsica, closely followed by thousands of refugees fleeing in disorganized columns in civilian ships. Speaking in Ajaccio, Pétain announced the creation of “Free France” and that his government would endeavor to “resist the threat of perilous bolshevism and reclaim France for the rightful kingdom.” Given his position, Pétain’s threats are empty, but for now we have more pressing concerns than Corsica. Let the old reactionary rot in his new fiefdom. He may own the land, but we own the future."
 french_revolution.42.a:0 "Let him rule his personal fiefdom for now."

 french_revolution.43.t:0 "The Trial of Philippe Pétain"
 french_revolution.43.d:0 "Captured while trying to escape in Marseilles, former Field Marshall Philippe Pétain and his cadre of supporters were brought before a Revolutionary Tribunal this morning. Charged with crimes against the French people, Pétain, along with all those associated with him, were sentenced to death by hanging. The Lion of Verdun was reportedly silent during the ruling, and maintained his composure even up until his execution. Other members of the NSF, like Jacques Doriot, however, had to be restrained and eventually was shot by an exasperated member of the Revolutionary Guard. With the death of Pétain, the NSF has largely disappeared from public life, and we can finally declare a true victory over the reactionary forces."
 french_revolution.43.a:0 "Let's hope that we can do better."

 french_revolution.44.t:0 "Doriot declares himself Grand Maréchal"
 french_revolution.44.d:0 "At a special party convention, NSF Front Leader Doriot has declared himself Grand Maréchal of the French State. The position, created by Doriot, grants him absolute power over France and the party. Whatever concerns the rest of the party might have were kept quiet, as any signs of dissent are being violently put down by Doriot’s Blackshirt paramilitaries. Any concept of democracy in France has, at last, been smothered by Doriot’s regime."
 french_revolution.44.a:0 "Vive le Grand Marshall!"

 french_revolution.45.t:0 "Refugees flee via the Underground Railroad"
 french_revolution.45.d:0 "Our authoritarian policies have lead to mass flight from France into the surrounding countries. Political dissidents, undesirables and the like have fled from the country, taking valuable potential manpower with them."
 french_revolution.45.a:0 "We didn't need them anyway."

 french_revolution.46.t:0 "France abolishes the Monarchy"
 french_revolution.46.d:0 "In the aftermath of the French Civil War, the new leader of the government, Jacques Doriot, has abolished the Bourbon monarchy. Many warhawks in our government believe that this is a gross injustice, and that Spain should intervene directly to restore the King-Regent to the throne. On the other hand, an invasion of France would be a costly endeavor, both in terms of materiel and manpower, and some believe we should simply abandon our ambitions in France."
 french_revolution.46.a:0 "Intervene to restore the rightful Bourbon King"
 french_revolution.46.b:0 "Abandon our ambitions on France."

 french_revolution.47.t:0 "Restoring France?"
 french_revolution.47.d:0 "Now that the French State has been defeated, we should turn our attentions on the restoration of the Bourbon Monarchy in France."
 french_revolution.47.a:0 "Of course."
 french_revolution.47.b:0 "We should maintain our occupation."

 french_revolution.48.t:0 "The country has begun to collapse."
 french_revolution.48.d:0 "The French Civil War has ground on for more than a year. The total collapse of civil order has begun to seriously take its toll on the French nation. Hundreds of thousands have fled to neighboring nations, fostering a terrible refugee crisis. Mass starvation and disease have gripped the countryside as access to basic resources has become a luxury. Our war effort is very quickly on the verge of collapse as access to men and materiel is becoming more and more difficult by the day."
 french_revolution.48.a:0 "This damnable war just won't end!"

 french_revolution.49.t:0 "The country has begun to collapse."
 french_revolution.49.d:0 "The French Civil War has ground on for more than a year. The total collapse of civil order has begun to seriously take its toll on the French nation. Hundreds of thousands have fled to neighboring nations, fostering a terrible refugee crisis. Mass starvation and disease have gripped the countryside as access to basic resources has become a luxury. Our war effort is very quickly on the verge of collapse as access to men and materiel is becoming more and more difficult by the day."
 french_revolution.49.a:0 "This damnable war just won't end!"

 french_revolution.50.t:0 "The Future of Wallonia"
 french_revolution.50.d:0 "Having won our independence from the French, the new Wallonian parliament faces a dilemma on the future of the nation. Given our precarious position, it has been suggested that we seek protections from the nearby Netherlands. A more radical position, pushed by the small Flemish minority, is that we should allow the Netherlands to annex Wallonia entirely. Alternatively, we can attempt to stand alone without any international protections."
 french_revolution.50.a:0 "Request Dutch protection"
 french_revolution.50.b:0 "Request Dutch annexation"
 french_revolution.50.c:0 "Stand alone."

 french_revolution.51.t:0 "Wallonia seeks protection"
 french_revolution.51.d:0 "Newly independent from France, the Wallonian parliament has requested protection from the Dutch government. Though small, Wallonia is a potential breakthrough point into both France and the Netherlands. Protecting them, though it might drag us into conflict, could provide a helpful barrier against German aggression."
 french_revolution.51.a:0 "And we shall provide it."
 french_revolution.51.b:0 "Not worth our time."

 french_revolution.52.t:0 "Corsica seeks Protections"
 french_revolution.52.d:0 "With the fall of the French Empire, Marshal Pétain has declared a Free French state on the island of Corsica, just off the coast of Marseilles. With little more than a few disorganized militias and very little equipment, the island is just waiting to be invaded and conquered by the newly formed French Republic. \n\n That is, of course, unless we provide protection to them. Pétain’s already unsteady government might be able to stabilize itself if it were provided aid and protection by their Spanish brethren."
 french_revolution.52.a:0 "Recognize them as the Legitimate French Government"
 french_revolution.52.b:0 "They're little more than a rump state."

 french_revolution.53.t:0 "Holland refuses our Request"
 french_revolution.53.d:0 "The Dutch government has refused to provide us protection. \n\n We must look elsewhere."
 french_revolution.53.a:0 "That's unfortunate."

 french_revolution.54.t:0 "Wallonia seeks Annexation"
 french_revolution.54.d:0 "In light of the French Civil War and their newfound independence, the Wallonian government has requested annexation into the Netherlands. Believing this will provide greater protection and stability, the Wallonian provisional government has simply requested that, in return, they be provided a certain level of autonomy within the Dutch nation."
 french_revolution.54.a:0 "Can't say no to free land, I guess."

 french_revolution.55.t:0 "The French United Front?"
 french_revolution.55.d:0 "Another major nation has attempted to intervene in the French conflict. Some in our government believe we should try and form a united front to fight back."
 french_revolution.55.a:0 "We should seek to form a united front"
 french_revolution.55.b:0 "We're fine, thanks."

 french_revolution.56.t:0 "The Revolutionaries propose a truce"
 french_revolution.56.d:0 "Given the intervention by other major powers in the French Civil War, the revolutionaries have approached us with a truce to fight against the enemy."
 french_revolution.56.a:0 "Probaby not a bad idea."
 french_revolution.56.d:0 "No!"

 french_revolution.57.t:0 "Nationalist France refuses"
 french_revolution.57.d:0 "The Nationalist French forces have refused our offer of an armistice."
 french_revolution.57.a:0 "Damn."

 french_revolution.58.t:0 "The End of the United Front"
 french_revolution.58.d:0 "With the larger enemy defeated, we can now turn our attentions back to defeating the nationalist forces."
 french_revolution.58.a:0 "Let's finish this."

 french_revolution.59.t:0 "Hong Kong is undefended."
 french_revolution.59.d:0 "With France in chaos, the treaty port of Hong Kong is now almost entirely undefended, save a small garrison force. We should storm the city and try to seize control by force!"
 french_revolution.59.a:0 "Seize the port!"
 french_revolution.59.b:0 "We cannot achieve this right now."

 french_revolution.60.t:0 "French Syria is vulnerable"
 french_revolution.60.d:0 "The former Ottoman region of Syria, owned by the French, has been left vulnerable by the chaos in France proper. Seizing the region would be relatively easy with the French colonial forces busy elsewhere."
 french_revolution.60.a:0 "Seize the region!"
 french_revolution.60.b:0 "We can't risk it right now."

 france_flavour.1.t:0 "The 1936 Tour de France"
 france_flavour.1.d:0 "Today marks the beginning of the 1936 Tour de France, the 30th edition of the Tour de France events held in 1903. This year’s events are particularly interesting, as the long-running rivalry between Sylvère Maes of the Netherlands and Antonin Magne. The two have had a brief rivalry, roughly mirroring the rivalry between the French and Dutch Empires. Thousands of Frenchmen and foreigners have flooded the streets of major cities to observe the festivities."
 france_flavour.1.a:0 "How interesting."

 france_flavour.2.t:0 "Reformation Day Celebrations"
 france_flavour.2.d:0 "Thousands of Frenchmen have flooded the streets today in celebration of Reformation Day. Marking the date of the creation of the first French constitution, Reformation Day is celebrated throughout France and the greater French Empire as a national holiday. Even with the world seemingly on a knife’s edge, the French people can still find time for festivities."
 france_flavour.2.a:0 "Vive le Empire!"

 france_flavour.4.t:0 "Armistice Day"
 france_flavour.4.d:0 "Today is Armistice Day, marking the date upon which the Great War ended. The holiday is solemn for millions of French men and women, many of whom lost friends and family during the conflict. [Root.GetLeader], speaking at the Verdun battle site, encouraged solidarity among Frenchmen to ensure that never again would such a mass tragedy be allowed to occur."
 france_flavour.4.a:0 "Let us hope it never happens again."

 france_flavour.6.t:0 "The Surrealist Manifesto"
 france_flavour.6.d:0 "Published by Marcel Duchamp, the so-called Surrealist Manifesto has begun to make the rounds among many art circles in Metropolitan France. Duchamp, a notable artist among Parisian intelligentsia, has been making waves in recent years with his rejections of common artistic tropes. Duchamp’s pieces have garnered both scorn and admiration by many, with more conservative voices decrying his work as “meaningless.” \n\n Duchamp, along with many others, have referred to their art as “Surrealist” or “Dada”, with Duchamp himself even coining the term “Anti-Art” to describe his pieces. Artists like Duchamp have helped to maintain Paris’ reputation as a major art center, rivaled only by her sister city Madrid and Barcelona."
 france_flavour.6.a:0 "How terribly interesting."
