  PB_TEX_Between_Giants:0 "A Republic Between Giants"
   PB_TEX_Between_Giants_desc:0 "Even before the Northern Revolution, Tejas had been divided between Mexicans and Americans, and the British and Spanish. Now, it finds itself still divided among political, racial, and foreign lines. The American Commonwealth to the east sits as the British-backed hegemon, while the Empire to the south lurks, waiting for an opportunity to strike at Tejas's freedom. While this nationalistic fervor will ensure our country is never seized by imperialists, racial and political tensions only further divide our nation..."
 PB_TEX_The_Texan_Boom:0 "Economic Boom"
 PB_TEX_The_Texan_Boom_desc:0 "Tejas has emerged as one of the most economically stable nations in the American continent. With a business friendly government, a stable democracy (at least on the surface), and an ample coastline, Tejas has found itself the subject of foreign investment and cross-continental trade. In addition, cooperation with the American Commonwealth and the British Empire, despite large-scale economic stagnation in both nations, have entrenched our prosperity with some of the greatest powers in the world."
 PB_TEX_pragmatic_president:0 "The Pragmatic President"
 PB_TEX_pragmatic_president_desc:0 "With all the racial tensions facing Tejas, President Adolfo de la Huerta has toed the line between Tejano and Anglo, and pushed forward numerous reforms to heal the divides facing Tejas. However, despite all the compromises made by de la Huerta's government, not much substantive reform has actually gone through, and tensions are still as high as ever. For every speech de la Huerta makes announcing renewed prosperity in Tejas, more violence occurs in the frontier. Something must be done, but is de la Huerta brave enough to act?"
PB_TEX_the_settler_conflict:0 "Tejano-Anglo Tensions"
PB_TEX_the_settler_conflict_desc:0 "The settler conflict has been eating away at our nation for years, and the collapse of the Mexican Empire has only made it worse. Widespread economic collapse in the American Commonwealth has led to a massive immigration wave from Anglos in the East, while Mexicans in the south flee to our stable democracy. Enclaves divided among racial lines have only become more common with our increasing political polarization."

tejas.1.t:0 "Another Settler Wave"
tejas.1.d:0 "A wave of settlers, coming from the South of the American Commonwealth, have arrived in East Texas. While some have integrated themselves into already existing Hispanic communities, many have formed their own Anglo towns, further increasing chaos in the already fragile Eastern states.\n\nThese new waves have certainly not helped de la Huerta's plans to reconcile settlers and Tejanos, and another such wave could throw our govermnent into chaos."
tejas.1.a:0 "Let's hope they don't cause any trouble..."

tejas.2.t:0 "Worrying Reports"
tejas.2.d:0 "According to numerous Eastern news sources, widespread conflict has erupted between existing Hispanic communities and this new wave of settlers, many of them Anglos from the Southern U.S.. According to our military, settlers attacked Tejano farms, stealing cattle and looting military outposts. The settlers, however, claim that Tejanos were the one who attacked the settler communities, claiming that the Anglo populace was not welcome in the East."
tejas.2.a:0 "Condemn the Anglos."
tejas.2.b:0 "Surely there can be compromise?"

tejas.3.t:0 "The Northern Occupation"
tejas.3.d:0 "It appears that words will no longer solve the conflicts facing Tejas. Settlers, emboldened by their recent conflicts with the Tejano population, have launched a full occupation of many areas in the Oklahoma Territory. Some of the settlers, aligned with the Anglo supremacist Know Nothing Party, have even minted their own currency and formed their own local governments free from the tyranny of "Tejano imperialism". The Know Nothing Party leader, Andrew Jackson Houston, has stayed quiet so far, but many Tejanos already distrust where his loyalties lie.\n\nOur government must solve this pressing issue - whether through placation or military force. de la Huerta's ministers are pressuring him for compromise, but many of the Tejano conservative groups and the military itself are pushing for a swift destruction of these upstart anglos."
tejas.3.a:0 "¡por Dios!"

tejas.4.t:0 "The Military's Mission"
tejas.4.d:0 "On the behest of de la Huerta, General Virgilio Norberto Cordero has been given full power over the military and their operations against the anti-government settler communities. Cordero spoke to cheering Tejano crowds about his operations and the new military situation last week, claiming that Andrew Jackson Houston and his "gringo rebels" shall be defeated and tried for their crimes against Tejas. Although Houston's actual position on the de-facto settler states is unknown, Cordero's accusation spread throughout Tejano newspapers, and it was alleged that Houston himself has now gone into hiding, forfeiting his seat in the Tejano government along with many other Know Nothing's out of protest for de la Huerta's actions."
tejas.4.a:0 "Let's hope there's no civil war..."

tejas.5.t:0 "The Second Battle of the Alamo"
tejas.5.d:0 "The battle for the fate of Tejas has begun. A large amount of settlers, armed with artillery and thousands of rifles, have taken up a defensive position in the Alamo Mission once more, in a homage to the darkest hour of the failed Texan Revolution of the 1800s. With control over the Alamo mission, the settlers then hope to seize federal government buildings in San Antonio, fully taking over the apparatus of government and crowning Andrew Jackson Houston as the new president.\n\nHowever, to do that, they first must resist the Tejano forces of General Cordero, who are looking for a repeat of the same outcome of the first Texan Revolution. WWith the odds in their favor, it seems that Cordero will easily seize the Alamo and bring an end to the Second Revolution - but one should never underestimate Anglo resolve in the face of sure defeat."
tejas.5.a:0 "Drive back the Mexican dogs!"
tejas.5.b:0 "¡Degüello! Give them no quarter!"
