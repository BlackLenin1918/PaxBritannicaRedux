PB_SPR_national_movement_split:0 "Movimiento Nacional Divided"
PB_SPR_national_movement_split_desc:0 "The National Movement is a loose coalition of several right, to far-right political parties working together against the socialist menace of the Republican authority. This National Movement, however, is not a ideological monolith and exists out of several political branches: Falangists, Legitimists, Carlists and the old CEDA all struggle for control of the state apparatus and political infighting has become increasingly prominent, with political assassination and other dirty tricks not being as unusual as during the Second Republic. The next congress of the National Movement will finally make clear which faction will become the biggest of the Movement."
PB_SPR_military_coup:0 "The Mary coup"
PB_SPR_military_coup_desc:0 "The recent coup d’état against the old republican government still is in full swing, as the nationalist military has started its purging of the old radical socialists of the PSOE and CNT, while the republican forces reorganize themselves in the city of Barcelona. While Mola does not enjoy the support of most of the Spanish populace, he does reign with the support of the national armed forces and navy and is able to consolidate the power of the loose coalition, known as the national movement. This reign of terror, while effective in consolidating power, has enraged the unions and socialist workers of Spain and many fear that the tension can easily spark another civil conflict."
PB_SPR_treaty_1:0 "Treaty of A Coruña"
PB_SPR_treaty_1_desc:0 "The Treaty of A Coruña is for many Spanish nationalists a humiliation Spain has to overcome in the next decade. The Treaty, signed by the chaotic second Spanish Republic in 1912, made an end to Spanish hegemony overseas and limited the Spanish army, navy and airforce. Spain and its Bourbon dynasty also were forced to take the blame for the Great War partly, sharing it with France, and thus being forced to repay the Entente for the costly Iberian campaign. The treaty is seen differently by the different groups of the Movimiento Nacional, but all parties do agree upon ending the treaty in the near future. \n\n§RIf Spain yields an army above 100 000 men or if Spain has accepted a Bourbon monarch on her throne, Britain will demand us to follow the treaty of A Coruña or face the consequences of war against the full force of Britain and the Commonwealth of Independent States.§!"

spain.1.t:0 "The Mary Coup Chaos"
spain.1.d:0 "Not too long ago, Emilio Mola with support of the army and the right-wing of Spain, has been able to stage a violent coup against the anti-catholic republican government. The republican government was founded in 1911, one year before the official signing of the treaty of A Coruña, founded on the ruins of Madrid after the brutal civil war between Alfonso loyalists and republican forces. However, the years after the treaty were quite unstable with rebellion after rebellion. While stability has always been rare for Spain, the Republicans never bothered to fix the instability and created enemies on all fronts. The 1931 elections would prove to be the last straw, as democratic traditions grinded to a halt with the opposition and coalition not being able to work with the rising Falange party. On the 29th of October, 1932, after a proposal to ban the Falangist party, the party members ran out of parliament, forcing snap elections upon Spain. Those snap elections would never come. With support of the army and the CEDA party, the Falange was able to coup the republican government on the 18th of December. The death of Sanjurjo on the 30th of December forced Emilio Mola to become the next head of state. However, republican forces, while broken, are not defeaten and are organizing themselves on the borders of the Spanish state. Can Mola crush this government and start a new age for Spain?"
