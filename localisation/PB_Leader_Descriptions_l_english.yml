 ASK_Vasily_Korzh_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 01/13/1899\n\n§YVasily Korzh§! was born into an impoverished peasant family in Belorussia. Living in the intense poverty of Tsarist Russia, he was forced to grow resourceful from an early age. Tragedy seemed to follow him like a specter, as his father would be drafted and subsequently killed during the Great War. Not long after, the arrival of the Great Pestilence ended his mother's life, along with most of his village.\n\nVasily would spend the 1920s as a ward of the state, raised by the increasingly ultranationalist Russian government. After turning eighteen, he joined the Imperial Russian army, just in time to witness the collapse of the postwar European economy and the Long Depression. Ultimately, he would return to his homeland of Belorussia not as a visitor, but as a conquerer. Deployed to the region to quell nationalist unrest, he gained infamy among the military for his brutality in crushing a series of bread riots in Minsk. It would be this brutality that earned him a position within the Okhrana.\n\nAs time passed and Russia fell further into ultranationalist revanchism, Korzh found himself with a new assignment in the colony of Novorossiya. The colony had become, essentially, a dumping ground for political undesirables, earning it the nickname of the Prison State. Vasily now rules the colony with a begruding iron fist, believing his reassignment to be a politically motivated move due to his non Russian heritage. Being the Empire's warden may not be the most engaging work, but it does at least pay the bills."
 BAL_Anton_Denikin_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 16/12/1872\n\nBorn in the Warsaw Governate of the Russian Empire, now part of Congress Poland, §YAnton Denikin§! is a man of little compromise. Driven by his father's patriotism and religious faith, he would join the Imperial Russian Army and ultimately see combat on the Far Eastern Front of the Great War. It was in this storm of steel that Denikin would make his name, helping to lead a daring assault on Seoul during the collapse of the Japanese front.\n\nIn the intervening years, Denikin became a vocal proponent of the Russian ultranationalist Bratsvto party. This came in conjunction with his deployment to the Western provinces during the 1920 Nationalist Rebellions, which saw Russia's Westernmost territories erupt in secessionist fervor. Denikin served with distinction in the defeat of the Baltic Partisan forces and would later command troops during the calamitous Finnish Offensive.\n\nYears have passed since then, and now Denikin rules the Baltic Governate, officially the Baltic Autonomous Provinces. In reality, the Baltics are Denikin's personal fiefdom, ruled with a level of despotic ferosity that would shock even the brutal colonial regimes of Africa. Civil rights are nonexistent, mass killings are rampant, and Denikin has made it his personal mission to rid the Baltic of supposed Jewish-German influences. Denikin is one of the most fervent supporters of the Moscow regime, and will gladly raze the Baltics to the ground if it would mean furthering the ambitions of Mother Russia."
 TRS_Nikolai_Yudenich_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 30/7/1862\n\n§YNikolai Nikolayevich Yudenich§! was born to a minor court official in Moscow, where he would later graduate from the Alexandrovsky Military College in 1881. During the Great War, Yudenich would serve during the Manchuria Campaign, an unofficial front in the war oft regarded as an illegal occupation by most historians. This campaign was largely an effort by Imperial Russia to squash nascent pro-Japanese elements in Manchuria while also securing the region's agricultural base and serving as a springboard for the invasion of Japanese-occupied Korea.\n\nLike many generals, Yudenich spent much of the Interwar fruitlessly attempting to justify and explain the military blunders of the Far Eastern Front. Again, like many generals, he found himself forced to turn his army's weapons on his own countryment during the 1920 Rebellions. For Yudenich, his actions in the pacifications remain a wound on his psyche. A wound that festered and ultimately drove Yudenich into a deep depression.\n\nWhile normally this would just be another tragic story of psychological breakdown, the key problem is Yudenich's appointment as Viceroy of the Caucuses precisely because of his efficiency in partisan suppression. Yudenich's depression and seclusion has paralyzed the Caucasus government, leaving the Russian administration barely capable of keeping the region under control. Day and night, Yudenich remains either in his office or, increasingly as of late, infirm in bed. The old man remains the only thin fiber holding the rebellious mountains from being set alight once more."
