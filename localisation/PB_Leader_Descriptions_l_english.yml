 ASK_Vasily_Korzh_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 01/13/1899\n\n§YVasily Korzh§! was born into an impoverished peasant family in Belorussia. Living in the intense poverty of Tsarist Russia, he was forced to grow resourceful from an early age. Tragedy seemed to follow him like a specter, as his father would be drafted and subsequently killed during the Great War. Not long after, the arrival of the Great Pestilence ended his mother's life, along with most of his village.\n\nVasily would spend the 1920s as a ward of the state, raised by the increasingly ultranationalist Russian government. After turning eighteen, he joined the Imperial Russian army, just in time to witness the collapse of the postwar European economy and the Long Depression. Ultimately, he would return to his homeland of Belorussia not as a visitor, but as a conquerer. Deployed to the region to quell nationalist unrest, he gained infamy among the military for his brutality in crushing a series of bread riots in Minsk. It would be this brutality that earned him a position within the Okhrana.\n\nAs time passed and Russia fell further into ultranationalist revanchism, Korzh found himself with a new assignment in the colony of Novorossiya. The colony had become, essentially, a dumping ground for political undesirables, earning it the nickname of the Prison State. Vasily now rules the colony with a begruding iron fist, believing his reassignment to be a politically motivated move due to his non Russian heritage. Being the Empire's warden may not be the most engaging work, but it does at least pay the bills."
 BAL_Anton_Denikin_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 16/12/1872\n\nBorn in the Warsaw Governate of the Russian Empire, now part of Congress Poland, §YAnton Denikin§! is a man of little compromise. Driven by his father's patriotism and religious faith, he would join the Imperial Russian Army and ultimately see combat on the Far Eastern Front of the Great War. It was in this storm of steel that Denikin would make his name, helping to lead a daring assault on Seoul during the collapse of the Japanese front.\n\nIn the intervening years, Denikin became a vocal proponent of the Russian ultranationalist Bratsvto party. This came in conjunction with his deployment to the Western provinces during the 1920 Nationalist Rebellions, which saw Russia's Westernmost territories erupt in secessionist fervor. Denikin served with distinction in the defeat of the Baltic Partisan forces and would later command troops during the calamitous Finnish Offensive.\n\nYears have passed since then, and now Denikin rules the Baltic Governate, officially the Baltic Autonomous Provinces. In reality, the Baltics are Denikin's personal fiefdom, ruled with a level of despotic ferosity that would shock even the brutal colonial regimes of Africa. Civil rights are nonexistent, mass killings are rampant, and Denikin has made it his personal mission to rid the Baltic of supposed Jewish-German influences. Denikin is one of the most fervent supporters of the Moscow regime, and will gladly raze the Baltics to the ground if it would mean furthering the ambitions of Mother Russia."
 TRS_Nikolai_Yudenich_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 30/7/1862\n\n§YNikolai Nikolayevich Yudenich§! was born to a minor court official in Moscow, where he would later graduate from the Alexandrovsky Military College in 1881. During the Great War, Yudenich would serve during the Manchuria Campaign, an unofficial front in the war oft regarded as an illegal occupation by most historians. This campaign was largely an effort by Imperial Russia to squash nascent pro-Japanese elements in Manchuria while also securing the region's agricultural base and serving as a springboard for the invasion of Japanese-occupied Korea.\n\nLike many generals, Yudenich spent much of the Interwar fruitlessly attempting to justify and explain the military blunders of the Far Eastern Front. Again, like many generals, he found himself forced to turn his army's weapons on his own countryment during the 1920 Rebellions. For Yudenich, his actions in the pacifications remain a wound on his psyche. A wound that festered and ultimately drove Yudenich into a deep depression.\n\nWhile normally this would just be another tragic story of psychological breakdown, the key problem is Yudenich's appointment as Viceroy of the Caucuses precisely because of his efficiency in partisan suppression. Yudenich's depression and seclusion has paralyzed the Caucasus government, leaving the Russian administration barely capable of keeping the region under control. Day and night, Yudenich remains either in his office or, increasingly as of late, infirm in bed. The old man remains the only thin fiber holding the rebellious mountains from being set alight once more."
 GER_Georg_I_Desc:0 "Emperor of Austria, Emperor of the United Kingdoms of Germany, King of Bohemia, Apostolic King of Hungary, of Dalmatia, of Croatia, of Slavonia, of Lodomeria and of Illyria, King of Jerusalem and so forth. Archduke of Austria, Duchess of Lorraine, of Salzburg, of Styria, of Carinthia, of Carniola, Margrave in Moravia, Prince of Trent and Brixen, Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia and in Istria, Lord of Trieste, of Cattaro and of the Windic March, Sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\n§YBorn:§! 2/4/1880\n\n§YGeorg Franz Joseph Luitpold Maria Prinz von Bayern§! is the eldest son of Prince Leopold of Bavaria and Archduchess Gisela of Austria. Reportedly the favored grandson of Kaiser Franz Joseph, Prince Georg would enter the Deutsches Heer in 1897. During his time serving under the Heer, he would take part in multiple engagements across the Western Front in the French and Italian theatres. Most notably, his Bavarian cavalry unit would take part in the third Battle of Vittorio Veneto, one of the bloodiest battles of the Great War's European theatre.\n\nIn the years since the conflict, he would go on to marry Archduchess Isabella of Austria and spent the majority of his time studying theology. With the abdication of Kaiser Rudolf, however, Georg's ties to the Austrian Royal family granted him a tenuous chance at the throne. Pressured by King Rupprecht of Bavaria, Georg's gambit has paid off and earned him the title of Kaiser. Whether or not he will remain a puppet of Rupprecht's ambitions or not remains to be seen."
 GER_Elisabeth_I_Desc:0 "Empress of Austria, Empress of the United Kingdoms of Germany, Queen of Bohemia, Apostolic Queen of Hungary, of Dalmatia, of Croatia, of Slavonia, of Lodomeria and of Illyria, Queen of Jerusalem and so forth. Archduchess of Austria, Duchess of Lorraine, of Salzburg, of Styria, of Carinthia, of Carniola, Margrave in Moravia, Princess of Trent and Brixen, Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia and in Istria, Lord of Trieste, of Cattaro and of the Windic March, Sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece \n\n§YBorn:§! 2/9/1883\n\n§YElisabeth Marie Henriette Stephanie Gisela§! is the daughter of the now abdicated Kaiser Rudolf II and Baroness Mary Vetsara. Much of the Kaiserin's early life is unremarkable, having received very little interest from Empress Elisabeth of Germany, who reportedly detested her status as a grandmother. The Kaiserin's education and upringing were similarly standard for a member of the Austrian Royal Family, though she would rebuff pressures from her Father to marry the Hohenzollern crown prince, an incident that would strain tensions between the two families.\n\nFollowing the death of Franz Joseph and the accession of Rudolf to the throne, the Archduchess would take a more prominent role in Austrian politics. Most notably she openly endorsed the post-war socialist governments and offered her support to the women's suffrage movement in Austria. Now, imbued with the powers of the sovereign, the \"Red Kaiserin\" can push her agenda of reform."
