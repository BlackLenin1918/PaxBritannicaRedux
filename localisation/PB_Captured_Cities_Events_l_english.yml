PBCity.1.t:0 "British Troops march through Paris"
PBCity.1.d:0 "Paris, the city of Romance and the heart of the French nation, has fallen to continued British war effort. While many in the French government feared the idea of British troops marching through the champs Élysées, only a few thought of it as a possible reality due to the optimistic and romantic nationalism of the French party. With British soldiers now occupying the city, streetfighting and urban warfare has become a small thorn in the paw of the lion. The British have already arrested hundreds of [FRA.GetLeader]'s followers and several thousands have yet to be properly found by British military authorities."
PBCity.1.a:0 "How long will this war last?"
PBCity.1.b:0 "Our boys will end this war!"
PBCity.1.c:0 "Paris has fallen, France has not!"
PBCity.2.t:0 "Fall of Madrid"
PBCity.2.d:0 "For the second time in the history of Spain are American soldiers walking on Madrid soil during war. The city of Madrid, capital of Spain and the heart of Castillian nationalism, has fallen after a long military campaign in Iberia. The fall of Madrid has been celebrated by many across the commonwealth, as everyone remembers the later effects of Spanish capitulation had on the French war effort during the First Great War. The photos and films of the American soldiers that have captured the city have spread like wildfire in both Europe and America."
PBCity.2.a:0 "Interesting"
PBCity.2.b:0 "American power saves the day once again"
PBCity.2.c:0 "We will not let the Americans have their victory!"
PBCity.3.t:0 "Fall of Moscow"
PBCity.3.d:0 "After a long and hard campaign, Germany celebrates their recent victory against the Russian Empire at the battle of Moscow. After days of seiging and urban warfare, the city of Moscow has finally fallen into German hands. The Russian army, using a page out of their earlier wars against Napoleon, burned most of the old imperial city to the ground as to ensure a bitter victory for the Germans. \n\nThe German army has already begun to build up the defenses of Moscow as to defend against a Russian counterattack and the logistics of supplying the German armed forces in Moscow."
PBCity.3.a:0 "Napoleon, eat your heart out"
PBCity.3.b:0 "Germany continues to march on"
PBCity.3.c:0 "We'll beat them back!"
