PB_ROM_big_latin_sister:0 "The Big Latin Sister"
PB_ROM_big_latin_sister_desc:0 "Since our independence from the Ottoman Empire and the formation of the personal union between the kingdoms of Wallachia and Moldova, Romania’s elite and peasants have been surprisingly francophile, following the French trends of limited democracy and enlightenment ideals that came from the French enlightenment. This strong Francophile feeling is often translated as “big and little latin sisters”, describing the cultural bond between France and Romania rooted in the legacy of the Great Roman Empire that once ruled Dacia. This idealism has helped Romania into the Great War and has founded the basis of most of the Romanian far-right since Doriot’s government."
PB_ROM_regency:0 "Regency of Michael I"
PB_ROM_regency_desc:0 "Since the death of Ferdinand I, Michael I, his grandson, became the legitimate ruler of Romania. There was only one slight problem: Michael I was born in 1921 and was around the age of 6. This meant that Michael I could have never ruled Romania as an enlightened despot until 1939, forcing Romania into a regency council. The regency consists of three men: Prince Nicholas, second son of Ferdinand I, Miron Cristea, patriarch of the Romanian orthodox church, and Gheorge Buzdugan, head of the supreme court in Bucharest. The regency has now lasted 6 years and many in Romania are clearly yearning for a new king that will rule Romania."
PB_ROM_peasantry:0 "A Romanian life is a Peasants life"
PB_ROM_peasantry_desc:0 "While constant government efforts were made to modernize and industrialize Romania, almost 80% of its population keeps consisting of peasantry and a huge chunk of the economy remains dependant on the agricultural sector. While this has helped Romania in some forms and protected it during the economic crashes across Eastern Europe in the wake of the Great War, it continues to limit Romania’s economic capabilities and will not be able to support the needs of a modern, mechanized army that can keep Romania independent."
PB_ROM_legacy_of_carols_coup:0 "Legacy of Carol's Coup"
PB_ROM_legacy_of_carols_coup_desc:0 "Carol II's try at power in 1929 during the failed Romanian coup d’etat would set the present political landscape for Romania, one of a shared fear among party leadership for another attempt of removing the governing party of Romania as to replace it in favor of the authoritarian, nationalist and corrupt Carol II. This shared anti-Carol sentiment among all parties has created a  front against Carol, leading to party purges against traitors to Michael and his regent. Romania will remain gripped by this constant fear of instability till the death of Carol II."
PB_ROM_far_right:0 "Sneaking Power of the Legionaries"
PB_ROM_far_right_desc:0 "Since the Romanian loss of the Great War, radical ideas have been spread from the urban centre of Bucharest to the agrarian corners of the Romanian nation. The most popular ideas have been the once that are followed by the Iron Guard or Legionary Movement, a group of neo-imperialist radicals led by Corneliu Codreanu believing in the inherint values of being Romanian, agriculture and the orthodox monarchy. Their ideas have been on the rise ever since their split from the LANC and many fear the victory of the party in the upcoming 1933 election, as many men have become a loyal member to the Romanian death fetishists."

romania.1.t:0 "PSIR merges with SPR"
romania.1.d:0 "Due to the recent popularity of the Romanian far-right and the instability of our current cabinet, many socialist parties are trying to form an united opposition against the Romanian far-right. A clear example of this unification is the recent merge of the PSIR (Partidul Socialist Independent din România) with the Socialist Party of Romania under C. Popovici. The Socialist Party was once a splinter group of the social democrats, abandoning them as they were not radical enough in the eyes of Popovici's followers. The two parties share these radical ideas about republicanism and revolution and have thus merged into the United Socialist Party."
romania.1.a:0 "They will most likely not achieve anything..."
romania.2.t:0 "Bombing attack in Bucharest"
romania.2.d:0 "Shocking news dominated the newspapers of Romania today, as a bombing attack shakes the capital. The one responsible for the attack was quickly arrested by the police, claiming that the attack was planned by him and his comrades of the USP. While evidence is currently lacking to tie the attack with the radical USP, many Romanians have already turned their back on the new party after the attack. The Iron Guard has, as always, reaped the benefit, as the attack nicely fits in their ideology of violent socialism."
romania.2.a:0 "What a mess..."
