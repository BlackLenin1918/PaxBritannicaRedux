PB_HOL_religious_divide:0 "Protestant-Catholic Divide"
PB_HOL_religious_divide_desc:0 "The Dutch Republic is split between the north and the south, with the great Rhine river as divide. In the north of the Netherlands, protestantism and its values reign supreme. The absolute victory secured during our war of independence coincided with the protestant reformation, with protestant rights being one of the main factors leading to our war of independence. The protestant provinces of the Dutch Republic are clearly favored politically and see most of the economic action. In the north of the nation, catholic idealism and its grand cathedrals are common place, as the northern provinces of Brabant, Limburg and Flanders never joined the protestant side during the independence war. Their resistance would determine the fate of those provinces, becoming the political and economic backwater of the Dutch Republic, untill very recently with catholic emancipation."
PB_HOL_republican_agitation_1:0 "Republican Agitation - §Y(Small)§!" 
PB_HOL_republican_agitation_1_desc:0 "With the Great War acting like a wake-up call for many Dutch citizens, the Neo-Republicans have seen their rise in popularity in their endless pursuit of confronting the old regime of Stadtholderate. Many of their members have taken to the streets in protest of the position of Stadtholder and it seems that the time is nigh for political reform in the Dutch Republic..."
PB_HOL_colonial_empire:0 "Nederlandse Koloniale Rijk"
PB_HOL_colonial_empire_desc:0 "The Dutch Colonial Empire has been built piece by piece by the merchants, soldiers and elite of the Dutch Republic. Over the centuries, a large, continental colonial empire has been achieved. Although it suffered losses in the Great War, especially in the East Indian region with the local uprisings, the process of rebuilding and re-consolidating Dutch control has been relatively fast due to the uniquely Dutch way of colonial expansion and administration. Our pearl necklace will continue to shine."
