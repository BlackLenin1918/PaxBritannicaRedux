  POLITICS_Philipp_Bouhler_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!03/06/1896\n\n§YPhilipp Bouhler§! nicknamed the counsellor (§ODer Berater§!) has seen Prussia rise from the ashes as a rebirthed nation under Russian influence. A once simple farmboy turned solider during the great war he has seen the world at its quitest and loudest moments, serving in the Russian 3rd cavalry regiment. A regiment compromised of a Prussian majority that would soon turn against their forefathers in the Prussian war for independence during 1921. A war that proved successful in establishing a independent Prussia of sorts, heavily monitored by the Tsar's right hand.\n\nOriginally a fierce supporter of the democratic republic he soon saw through their antics and gained power through a bloody battle in Königsberg that lasted no longer than two days. Russia, meanwhile, looked with great interest towards Bouhler seeing him as a leader who aligned more towards their views and a possible proponent for a more Russian dominated Prussia. Secretly funding him and his Vaterland Front.\n\nFollowing the ideals of ultranationalism he advocates for a state incorporated by Pure Prussians though this "wish" would meet critism by his overlords and would usher in a new age of diplomatic strife between Europes two greatest powers. Germany and Russia. Nicknamed the §GGreat Game§!."
  
  Hermann_Hopker_Aschoff_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!15/02/1878\n\n§YHermann Hopker Aschoff§! was a main proponent of the short lived §LPrussian§! Republic though once §ODer Berater§! and his troops started marching through Königsberg he kept a silent voice of protest. He should be dead by all means especially during the midnight massacres though it seems his name was rubbed off the hit lists for one reason or another. Thats assuming it was on there to begin with. Now he finds himself chancellor of the republic he dreamed §LPrussia§! of being and has already begin reconstructing the nation to fit his perfect view of Democracy."

  PRS_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YPrussia§! is a bufferzone between §CRussia§! and §YGermany§! in Europe in 1933.\n\nPrussia, a nation that once stood mighty and strong is now nothing more but a state experiencing an unwakeable nightmare. After nationalist unrest erupted in the once Russian owned states of Prussia during the 1920s the Tsar was forced to kneel against his will to a Free state overseered by a democratic party compromised of conservatives. Though this wouldn't last for long and a ultranationilst coup would soon follow speer headed by §YPhilipp Bouhler§!. The result of such political strife is a technically independent Prussia with Russian oversight.\n\nThroughout Prussia's relatively short history she has endured political abuse by both her father nation, Germany and her cossack overlord, Russia. Nicknamed the §GGreat Game§! between §REnglish§! historians the formal concept of a bufferzone between the two powers has become a very real reality with both nations promising Prussia European prominence and most importantly, land. Combined with ethnic tensions and political issues relating to the Prussian junkers it is not unwise to say that the future for this ancient nation may not be a bright one, if there is a future for them at all.\n\nPrussia is a §YMinor Power§!."
 
  PRS_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "Prussia stands at the crossroads between Russia and Germany. A state divided ethnically and politicly she must traverse the dangerous waters of the two giants to ensure her survival. Though if she crashes her short lived independence will be forgotten entirely and her people enslaved yet again."

  PB_PRS_Prussonationalism_desc:0 "Prussonationalism is a unique form of ultranationalist doctrine birthed in Prussia in the aftermath of the Revolutions of the 1920s. In many ways, it is a synthesis of traditional Prussian martial values with modern far-right economic doctrine. The ideology primarily pushes for extreme ultra-traditionalism and anti-leftism, though conversely retaining a sort of ethnic pluralism to keep the not inconsiderable Polish, Russian and Baltic minorities from revolt."

  PB_PRS_Russian_Minority_desc:0 "Prussia's time as a de-facto part of the Russian Empire has lead to a dramatic shift in the nation's demographics. Though the Germans retain a general majority, the settlement of Russians was commonplace up until the 1920 Nationalist Revolutions in Eastern Europe. Due to this, there is a vocal portion of the population advocating for Prussia's return to the Russian Empire. These Russophile elements of Prussian society, if empowered, would likely see Prussia fully return to Russia's embrace. On the inverse, dealing with them is problematic, as disempowering a Russian minority on the border with Russia would likely be unhealthy for the nation's leadership..."
  PB_PRS_Ethnic_Tensions:0 "Ethnic Tensions"
  PB_PRS_Ethnic_Tensions_desc:0 "Prussia's ethnic situation has been degrading steadily since Independence. While the Russian minority hold considerable power over industry, there is also the issue of the nation's other minority groups, mainly the Poles and Lithuanians. Both of these groups are disproportionately affected by poverty and while the Prussonationalists have attempted to remain pluralistic, there are elements of the nationalist factions that wish to see these minorities Germanized or outright removed. Inversely, the Polish and Lithuanian minorities bleeding in over the porous border often have nationalist or left wing sentiments, leading to the Prussian borderlands becoming a thriving ecosystem of anti-Russian underground groups. This situation must be solved or at least brought under control or it may have dangerous consequences for the Prussian government."

"Shut Up" replied Peters making sure to not make eye-contact with his friend in case the worst happened. "What is he really going to do for us, eh?" "Now, really?

Tightly gripping onto his small service pistol while they tried to mangle him into a still position. The air was full of screams and pleas and during the choatic verbal mess the officer shouted his respected words. "You have been declared an enemy of the state by direct order of counsellor Bouhler and have been sentenced to death."
