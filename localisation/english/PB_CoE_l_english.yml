  PB_CoE_Conference_of_Europe:0 "The Conference of Europe"
  PB_CoE_Conference_of_Europe_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second war that has decimated Europe in 20 years has finally come to an end. Cities now resemble smoldering graveyards, while entire villages have been wiped off the map, either due to national projects of achieving \"natural populations\" or due to the hellish machines and innovations unleashed upon the continent during the war. Roads and railways are broken and beyond repair, while industrious factories now seem abandoned. \n\nWith the powers that challenged the status quo now destroyed, Britain, Germany and their allies now seek to partition the pie correctly. It remains to be seen how possible that will be, as some seek revenge for the devestation or national humiliation, while others seek to bring unity to a divided Europe. \n\nCurrent Topic of the Conference: [Coe_get_topic] \n"
  PB_CoE_Add_A_Demilitarization_Clause:0 "Demilitarisation of French Society"
  PB_CoE_Add_A_Demilitarization_Clause_desc:0 "To placate the German diplomats, we may introduce an extensive plan to demilitarise the French state to the Dexter Plan. This will hinder French capabilities to build autopods, tanks, artillery, bio-genetic weaponry, airplanes and any military-grade ship or submarine. While it may prove to be the hand the Germans needed to approve of this plan, it would seriously neuter a friendly French military in the forseeable future."
  PB_CoE_Allow_Lorraine_Occupation:0 "Occupy Lorraine"
  PB_CoE_Allow_Lorraine_Occupation_desc:0 "It seems unlikely that the Germans would be satisfied with simply keeping the current borders with France untouched. A compromise needs to be made, allowing the continued occupation of the previously demilitarised province of Lorraine by German forces. Britain will approve of the Lorraine occupation for at least 100 years, unless Germany decides to relinquish its control over the territory in the future."
  PB_CoE_A_Jewish_Homeland:0 "Discuss a Jewish Homeland"
  PB_CoE_A_Jewish_Homeland_desc:0 "The Jewish people have suffered immensely under the French regime, seeing insane forms of persecution. While a rather unorthodox proposal, a few German diplomats have proposed to grant the Jewish people a part of France as repayment for the unethical and immoral projects targetting French jews of the former French government."
  PB_CoE_GER_choose_place_for_israel:0 "Pick [FROM.GetName] as Jewish Homeland"
  PB_CoE_GER_choose_place_for_israel_desc:0 "Coastal, a nice climate and small: this territory is the perfect homeland for the Jewish people!"
  PB_CoE_Implement_Full_Deindustrialisation:0 "Total Deindustrialisation"
  PB_CoE_Implement_Full_Deindustrialisation_desc:0 "Schwarz, in his essay on France, draws an interesting picture of how Germany could completely dominate France for the next thousand years. Calling it \"turning back the clock\", this euphemistic phrase describes the systematic destruction of France's industrial capabilities, ranging from civilian production to the extraction of heavy resources. Through total deindustrialisation, France can be tied to a German market and remain subservient for the next decade to come."
  PB_CoE_Independent_Normandy_Compromise:0 "The Rouen Compromise"
  PB_CoE_Independent_Normandy_Compromise_desc:0 "To create such a powerful state in continental Europe is begging to destroy the delicate balance of power in the eyes of the British. While supportive of their German allies, the Brits will need some guarantee in the form of a bufferstate to keep the two great powers at some distance. Establishing an independent and neutral Normandy may do the trick."
  PB_CoE_A_Small_Occitan_State:0 "The Pau-Toulouse-Nimes Concept"
  PB_CoE_A_Small_Occitan_State_desc:0 "A German-French state with a Mediterranean border may be too much of a threat to the British navy in the region and its hold on North Africa, keeping the British diplomats with their hands tied on our proposed merger. While the establishment of an independent Occitania in Southern France may calm their nerves, we shouldn't be willing to completely abandon this important region of France. A small Occitania will have to do."
  PB_CoE_A_Large_Occitan_State:0 "Implement the Pan-Occitan Dream"
  PB_CoE_A_Large_Occitan_State_desc:0 "Southern France is a culture distinct from the urban jungle of Paris or the Anglo-Celtic fusion of cultures in the regions that were occupied by the Brits during the medieval era. Recognising this basic principle, Germany and Britain agree to the establishment of a fully independent Occitan state, encompassing all Occitan states stretching from the Pyrenees to the Italian border."
  PB_CoE_Occitania_of_both_Seas:0 "The Intermarium Concept"
  PB_CoE_Occitania_of_both_Seas_desc:0 "While strong, Occitania still needs more leverage on the international stage for the British to agree to our ambitious proposal. The Intermarium concept, coined by Bohemian thinker Jan Masaryk, proposes an Occitan state that borders both the Mediterranean and Atlantic, allowing it more options for a relationship with the British without the danger of isolation in the event of conflict in the Mediterranean."
  PB_CoE_France_in_Europe:0 "France's Place in Europe?"
  PB_CoE_France_in_Europe_desc:0 "While the German government has gone down the path of unifying the European continent under an unique federation of equal Europeans, the place of France in this new idea of Europe remains a question. Many former enemies of Paris are reluctant to allow the French any kind of equal status in this European confederation, but some have shown far more sympathy for France's place in this new global order. A few proposals are on the table."
  PB_CoE_Schwarz_Plan:0 "Implementing the Schwarz Plan"
  PB_CoE_Schwarz_Plan_desc:0 "France goes bye bye"
  PB_CoE_Italo_Franco_Border:0 "Redrawing the Franco-Italian Border"
  PB_CoE_Italo_Franco_Border_desc:0 "Our French ally has bled casualties during this war and now, stirred on by public opinion and the monarchy, is seeking to gain from the conflict. Specifically, the region of Provence has gained the interest of Italy, as an economically viable region with enough potential during reconstruction."
  PB_CoE_Question_of_Corsica:0 "Question of Corsica"
  PB_CoE_Question_of_Corsica_desc:0 "Having faced occupation by the French, the island of Corsica has become a small question mark in our larger treaty on France. Who is to govern over this little island of the coast of France and Italy? Is it better to restore the sovereign monarchy of the Bonapartes or award the island to an allied great power in the region?"
  PB_CoE_The_Parisian_Government:0 "New Parisian Government"
  PB_CoE_The_Parisian_Government_desc:0 "The French occupation authority is only made to be temporary, so a big question remains in the air during the conference: what kind of regime is to be imposed upon the French after their revanchist one? \n\nThe main two options seem to be a new Republican form of government or a constitutional monarchy without the Bourbons. A republic, while potentially a great boon for a flourishing French democracy in the future, was also the form of government that allowed Doriot and his party to perverse democracy into the revanchist threat we faced. A monarchy, meanwhile, may face new problems and could be seriously unpopular among the French people." 
  PB_CoE_Fate_of_Algeria:0 "Fate of Algeria"
  PB_CoE_Fate_of_Algeria_desc:0 "The French acquired the colony of Algeria after the Pied-Noir found themselves victorious during the civil conflict in the region. They longed to unify the old colony to the mainland and were under the Parisian thumb during the Second Great War. Now, we're facing a seriously complex situation. While the Pied-Noir are still loyal to Paris, the majority native population of Algeria would rather be governed by themselves, as an independent republic. The British, meanwhile, still prefer to return Algeria as a part of the Empire."

  COE.1.t:0 "Conference of Europe: The Main Course"
  COE.1.d:0 "As diplomats and heads of government and state gather around the packed hallways of Het Loo Palace, so graciously proposed to be the site of this historical conference by the Dutch crown, the conference slowly gets started. In a sideroom, not that noticeable when walking through the palace, the major players have started the conference with its main course: France. \n\nThe undoubted aggressor of this war, France acts like a mirror for many older diplomats in the room, reflecting upon the hasty decisions made in the aftermath of the first Great War that allowed for such a monster like Doriot to firmly grasp the wheel of the failed Republic. Among British diplomats, who seek to find an eternal solution to the continent's war problem, the old treaty is the perfect example of how not to go forward. Germany, on the other hand, has been the nation that suffered the most from the French invasion, with their border regions destroyed and their economy turned on its head after such an expensive war. Millions of marks in debt and the lives of many men lost, Germany's diplomats resent the British approach to the situation. In their eyes, the solution to France is clear: dismantlement. The degrees vary, but most German diplomats are keen on the idea of breaking the French spirit completely. \n\nAs papers are put on the round table and the big faces of Europe start speaking, the Conference of Europe has truly started."
  COE.1.a:0 "Hopefully, peace will be given a chance"
  COE.2.t:0 "Conference of Europe: France and Europe"
  COE.2.d:0 "With the continued effort of the German government to found upon the new world order a federation of European states, the question of France has continued to echo loudly through the halls of Het Loo. While the European project is defined by the united feeling of post-war stress and a new concept of Europeaness based on liberal democracy, Europeans like the French simply do not fit the same concept as the aggressors of the war. \n\nStill, a concept is on the table to divide the region of Burgundy into its own state and allow it to remain under the German wing. The argument mainly rests upon the idea of further weakening France's position, though it may worsen the narrative upon which the European project is being build upon."
  COE.2.a:0 "We can be European without the French"
  COE.2.b:0 "A German-aligned Burgundy is a perfectly fine concept"
  COE.3.t:0 "Conference of Europe: The Schwarz Proposal"
  COE.3.d:0 "Out of nowhere, the German delegation has backed a proposal written by German bureaucrat Franz Xaver Schwarz, deemed so radical that it has even taken the Turkish delegation aback. Schwarz is a known German ideologue, famed for his intellectual argumentation of anti-French sentiment. Using history and culture, Schwarz argues that the French have been a nation of expansionism since its inception and that it has to cease existing for peace in Europe to be viable. \n\nThe proposal pictures an Europe without France. The country is instead divided into its \"medieval\" parts, dividing the country among a Republic of the Seine, a Burgundian Kingdom, a Normandian state and a Southern Occitania. While Schwarz himself has gone even further, advocating for complete deindustrialisation and \"turning the clock back in France\", German diplomats still know how to be diplomatic and have thus kept those ideas out of the final draft. Still, the concept to the British delegation seems beyond unreasonable."
  COE.3.a:0 "Francia delenda est!"
  COE.4.t:0 "State turns Pastoral"
  COE.4.d:0 "The deindustrialization policy imposed upon us has hit another region of our country, as it becomes more bare and more people leave the region, hoping to find opportunities elsewhere."
  COE.4.a:0 "Devestation, oh devestation..."
  COE.5.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Franco-German Border"
  COE.5.d:0 "With millions and millions of casualties in this war, it is no surprise that some countries have come to the conference with a vengeance against the French state. One of these delegations is from our ally in Naples, which saw thousands of its own people slaughtered during the conflict. Now, stirred on by public opinion and the opinion of the royal court, the Italian delegation has proposed a redrawing of the border shared by France and Italy. \n\nIt is clear that the Italian delegation seeks repayment for the crimes committed by the French, but the question does remain on how much we can give to our Italian ally."
  COE.5.a:0 "War reparations, that will be all..."
  COE.5.b:0 "Grant them Savoy"
  COE.5.c:0 "Follow the Rhone Proposal"
  COE.6.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Corsica"
  COE.6.d:0 "The bizarre island of Corsica has, like many Francophone nations, been the victim of French revanchism during the war. Under Paris, Corsican culture experienced attempts at purification and turning it more French and the ruling monarchy of the island nation, the Bonapartes, were exiled by French forces. \n\nIt is now up to the Conference to decide who to grant the territory. While it may seem clear that the old Corsican regime is the only legitimate claimant to the island, both Italy and the UK have also expressed interests in the small island. Italy backs its claim by a historical basis, as Corsica was dominated by the merchant republic of Genoa during the medieval era. Britain, on the other hand, seeks to gain Corsica as a base of operation, granting the Brits another port in the Mediterranean."
  COE.6.a:0 "Restore the old government of Corsica"
  COE.6.b:0 "Grant the Italians the island"
  COE.6.c:0 "Grant the British the island"

  COE.x.t:0 "Conference of Europe: The Dexter Plan"
  COE.x.d:0 "Drawn up and proposed by famed Commonwealth economists Harry Dexter White and Henry Morgenthau, the Dexter Plan reeks of British influence. Proposing to minimize the partition of France, the Dexter Plan draws up a map of the pre-expansion borders of France, excluding the region around Dunkerque, which is given to Wallonian state. The plan further details several industrial occupation zones across the country, mainly meant to keep France's heavy industrial capabilities under the watchful eyes of the League of Nations. \n\nWhile a subtle and highly technical plan that promises peace on the continent, the German diplomats have been far less enthusiastic about the proposed plan than their British counterparts. Perhaps the plan can use some revision, but it is currently the proposal we put on the table."
  COE.x.a:0 "Let the vote begin..."
  COE.x.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Rathenau's Francia" 
  COE.x.d:0 "An interesting proposal has been put forward by the German delegation at Palace Het Loo. Concluding that Europe has been a continent plagued with wars for over decades at this point, often motivated through national competition and international anarchy, Rathenau's proposal has proposed the unification of the French and German states into one, collosal Frankenstein state. Inspired by the Empire of Charlemagne of the early medieval era, Rathenau coined the name \"Francia\" for his ambitious project of Franco-German unity. \n\nThe proposal has been met with skepticism by British diplomats, but the sudden relaxed tone from the German diplomats has forced the Brits into an interesting position: while unorthodox, this proposal is perhaps the best the UK will get in terms of a German-approved proposal that guarantees continental peace."
  COE.x.a:0 "Let the vote begin..."

  COE.7.t:0 "Dividing the Pie: Burgundy"
  COE.7.d:0 "Historically once part of the Holy Roman Empire, Burgundy is perhaps the region closest to Germany in many ways. A rural chunk of Eastern France, Burgundy may prove an useful puppet in the coming years. \n\nThe British have limited interests in the region, so they will not mind us taking this region."
  COE.7.a:0 "We will take Burgundy then"
  COE.7.b:0 "Let's establish it as a neutral bufferstate instead"
  COE.8.t:0 "Dividing the Pie: Normandy"
  COE.8.d:0 "Normandy, due to its coast on the English Channel and historical connections to the British, has been part of a larger British vision for quite some time now. If we'd give them this small piece of land, we can expect the British to be far more interested in our proposal."
  COE.8.a:0 "Actually, German Normandy sounds right, you know?"
  COE.8.b:0 "Let's placate the Brits with a bit of Normandy"
  COE.9.t:0 "Dividing the Pie: Occitania"
  COE.9.d:0 "The Southern region of France, Occitania is a state with a similar, yet different culture from North France. With a long history of persecution under the Parisian regime, Occitania isn't the most popular of ideas among locals, but is good enough of an excuse to establish a separate state with. \n\nSpecifically Italy has been interested in the region of Occitania, but the British may also want to rule the region, due to its Mediterranean coast, allowing for easy shipping to their North African colonies."
  COE.9.a:0 "A nice, sunny coast is perfect for German interests!"
  COE.9.b:0 "The Brits can have their Mediterranean coast"
  COE.9.c:0 "The Italians can use some territory"
  COE.10.t:0 "Dividing the Pie: Republic of the Seine"
  COE.10.d:0 "An artificial creation born out of the end of the second Great War's treaties, the Republic of the Seine is mainly important due to their Atlantic coast. The Bordeaux port may proof an excellent base for any Atlantic navy, so the British have been very keen on getting this particular piece of France. German diplomats have also shown interest, as the Bordeaux port may proof a good start for a German deep sea navy. \n\nWith conflict between German and British diplomats over this piece of land brewing, a solution may be necessary."
  COE.10.a:0 "We will take this coast for ourselves"
  COE.10.b:0 "Grant them the region..."
  COE.10.c:0 "The Brits can have it, but we will have Paris"
  COE.10.e:0 "We will take Bordeaux, the Brits can have Paris"

  COE.20.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Ending the France Debate"
  COE.20.d:0 "A few exasperated sighs filled the small room in Palace Het Loo, as diplomats and government figures neatly compiled their papers once again into their briefcases. The first round of discussions had concluded and the topic of France was settled. \n\nAs coffee, tea and some light celebratory wine was offered to the many men standing in the halls of Het Loo, the fate of Europe was closer to being further constructed."
  COE.20.a:0 "And the curtains close on this debate"
  COE.21.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Wallonia demands Reparations"
  COE.21.d:0 "As the conference started, one of the first delegations to loudly declare its national victimhood was from Wallonia. Despite the general sentiment among the diplomats at the conference that large parts of Walloon society wasn't opposed to French unification, the Walloon delegation was given the same patience and attention as every other delegation. During their time, they declared the horrors of French occupation to have been of exceptional degree in Wallonia, allowing the Walloon delegation to demand serious reparations from France. \n\nThe negotations about these reparations have gone from industrial reparations to even territory, but a conclusion has yet to be found."
  COE.21.a:0 "We won't give these \"victims\" anything"
  COE.21.b:0 "They will have to be happy with reparations"
  COE.21.c:0 "Grant them the Pas de Calais"
  COE.22.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Jewish Victims Fund"
  COE.22.d:0 "The war has had an immense impact on every European, soldier and civilian alike. However, certain groups of people have suffered excessive discrimination, persecution and worse under the French regime. Both the delegation of European Jews as the delegation of the zionist organization have had their time during the conference too, both describing the extreme measures of the French dictatorship against European jews, backed by various international humanist organizations and the information gathered by imperial divisions that liberated Alpine work camps. \n\nThe question now seems to be if giving the Jewish people a homeland is enough, or if a serious reparation fund needs to be placed on the French government for its inhumane treatment of its Jewish citizens and other Jewish civilians during the war."
  COE.22.a:0 "We can't place too much burden on the French..."
  COE.22.b:0 "The French will pay for their crimes"

  COEDEXTER.1.t:0 "The Discussion of a Jewish Homeland"
  COEDEXTER.1.d:0 "As British diplomats seek to further placate us with their Dexter Plan, the proposal of German diplomats to carve some territory away from France and give it to the Jewish people has been given the green light by the Brits. The Jewish people have suffered immensely under the French dictatorship, seeing themselves stripped from citizenship, property and sometimes their lives. The least we can do is come together and repay the Jewish people, a globally persecuted people, with their own homeland in France. \n\nThe question now remains which French state to grant the Jewish people. Preferably, the territory has a coast and isn't already claimed by another country."
  
  COEGOV.1.t:0 "Formalizing a Normandian Government"
  COEGOV.1.d:0 "With the establishment of an independent Normandy, a country that hasn't been a country since the age of Vikings, the question of government has been raised among the diplomats in Het Loo. The main problem is the exact type of government: will Normandy adhere to a monarch or be established as a republic? While the idea of a monarchy is interesting to many diplomats, the question of a king may proof to be difficult, especially after France's long experiment with Republicanism. The establishment of a Normandian Republic may prove more worthwile, as long as it is handled correctly and any member of the previous dictatorship is barred from holding office in the new republic."
  COEGOV.1.a:0 "Establish a Normandian Kingdom"
  COEGOV.1.b:0 "Establish a Normandian Republic"
  COEGOV.4.t:0 "The Tale of the Iron Crown"
  COEGOV.4.d:0 "Supposedly forged out of the iron nails used to crucify Christ the Lord himself, the Iron Crown of Lombardy has become an artifact that has traveled the continent in a short span of time. When Italy fell, the crown suddenly vanished out of Lombardy, but was quickly found in the streets of Vienna. Since then, the crown became property of the German state. \n\nWith the establishment of an independent North Italian kingdom under the rule of Peter Ferdinand, a Habsburg relative, the situation of the Iron Crown has been turned into a question once more. Pietro, an avid Italophile and catholic fanatic, has sought to restore the Iron Crown to his new kingdom, hoping to form a new identity in the North of Italy around the legendary kinds of Lombardy, the mercantile exploits of Venice and the artistic ways of Tuscany."
  COEGOV.4.a:0 "Give him the crown, we have no need for it"
  COEGOV.4.b:0 "A museum would be a proper place for this thing" 

  COENEWS.1.t:0 "PORTUGAL FALLS TO CIVIL WAR"
  COENEWS.1.d:0 "The restoration of the pre-Fatimist monarchy in Portugal with British and German support has taken a wrong term rather quickly. Supporters of the previous theocracy have taken up arms in the north of the country, challenging the legitimacy of the monarchy. \n\nIn a short amount of time, pro-monarchy and pro-fatamist elements have started rallying behind their respective banners in this conflict. With the lines drawn in the sand, the next conflict in Portugal promsies to turn the post-war government transition towards constitutional monarchy ever more bloody in Iberia."
  COENEWS.1.a:0 "The end is never the end"
  COENEWS.2.t:0 "FATIMISTS WIN IN PORTUGAL"
  COENEWS.2.d:0 "Despite the once seemingly impossible odds and the international support for Lisbon's monarchy, the Fatimist Front has been able to regain control over the entirety of continental Portugal once again. With the banners of the cross and Christ flying once more in Portugal, the monarchy has been put into exile once more, this time fleeing to London. \n\nThe defeat of the League-supported monarchy by the betrayed Fatamists has become an early crack in the post-war European design envisioned by Germany and Britain. Once again, a state with enough reason to despise both powers exists in Europe."
  COENEWS.2.a:0 "Portugal has been blessed once again"
  COENEWS.3.t:0 "MONARCHY WINS IN PORTUGAL"
  COENEWS.3.d:0 "As soon as it was restored post-war, the house of Braganza was put to the test by pro-Fatamist elements in Portuguese society. After a costly civil war and with the backing of the international community, Manuel II announced a start to peace in Portugal this evening. \n\nWith the house of Braganza now back in Lisbon after its lengthy exile, Portugal seems to be on course to fully commit itself to the League of Nations and cement its historical relationship with the British Empire."
  COENEWS.3.a:0 "A victory for the post-war construction"

  PB_Purged_Administration:0 "Purged Bureaucracy"
  PB_Purged_Administration_desc:0 "As part of the peace treaty, many figures of the previous government were barred from holding public office during their lifetime, seriously draining the pool of capable bureaucrats, politicians and diplomats in our country. It will take some time before inexperienced state employees can rise to the same level of expertise as the previous administration."

  PB_War_Reps_Dynamic_Modifier:0 "War Reparations"
  PB_War_Reps_Dynamic_Modifier_desc:0 "This nation has been absolutely defeated during the Second Great War and is now forced to pay for its destruction. Every month, the reserves are slowly growing more empty as the bill for destroyed buildings, smoking craters, civilian suffering and more is imposed on this country."

  RANIERI_DESC:0 "Italy has been defeated, dismantled and decimated. Sons and fathers have died and widows are all that are left. Germany and Britain, filled with a need for revenge against the aggressors of the second Great War, took Italy's destiny from its own hands and chained the Italian people to artificial creations, such as the new Kingdom of Two Sicilies. The recent crowning of king Ranieri I came when his brother, Ferdinand Pius, refused to rule over this artificial creation of a kingdom, stating that he would only represent the Italian people and not any bastardized form of this concept. Ranieri was the second choice, pressured by the British to accept the crown and rule this petty fiefdom as nothing more than a puppet of London. \n\nSecluded to his luxurious palaces in Naples, Ranieri can only watch as the incompetent government appointed by the Brits after the peace struggle to reconstruct the South of Italy after the war. Poverty, famine and disease plague these lands, which he may call himself a petty king of. A petty king, with petty aspirations, sitting in his petty castle." 
  PIETRO_DESC:0 "Following in the footsteps of the kings of medieval Northern Italy, claimant to the Iron Crown of Lombardy, Pietro II is far from as mythical as these kings. A relative to the German king, Peter Ferdinand changed his name to Pietro to emulate the habsburgs of Tuscany before him, claiming a mantle that has limited attachment to him personally. \n\nPietro II is a king more hated than loved. A foreign replacement imposed on the proud people of Northern Italy, roleplaying as an Italian monarch while disrespecting the symbols of Northern Italy, such as the Iron Crown and the legacy of the Lombardian people. It remains to be seen how long Pietro II can remain in power."
