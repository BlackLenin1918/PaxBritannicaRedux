  PB_CoE_Conference_of_Europe:0 "The Conference of Europe"
  PB_CoE_Conference_of_Europe_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second war that has decimated Europe in 20 years has finally come to an end. Cities now resemble smoldering graveyards, while entire villages have been wiped off the map, either due to national projects of achieving \"natural populations\" or due to the hellish machines and innovations unleashed upon the continent during the war. Roads and railways are broken and beyond repair, while industrious factories now seem abandoned. \n\nWith the powers that challenged the status quo now destroyed, Britain, Germany and their allies now seek to partition the pie correctly. It remains to be seen how possible that will be, as some seek revenge for the devestation or national humiliation, while others seek to bring unity to a divided Europe. \n\nCurrent Topic of the Conferece: [Coe_get_topic] \n\nCurrent Proposal: [Coe_get_proposal] \n\nCurrent additions to the proposal: \n[Coe_get_changes1] \n[Coe_get_changes2] \n[Coe_get_changes3] \n[Coe_get_changes4] \n\nCurrent chance of §Gapproval§! of the proposal:"
  PB_CoE_Add_A_Demilitarization_Clause:0 "Add Extensive Demilitarisation Clause"
  PB_CoE_Add_A_Demilitarization_Clause_desc:0 "To placate the German diplomats, we may introduce an extensive plan to demilitarise the French state to the Dexter Plan. This will hinder French capabilities to build autopods, tanks, artillery, bio-genetic weaponry, airplanes and any military-grade ship or submarine. While it may prove to be the hand the Germans needed to approve of this plan, it would seriously neuter a friendly French military in the forseeable future."
  PB_CoE_Allow_Lorraine_Occupation:0 "Allow Lorraine Occupation"
  PB_CoE_Allow_Lorraine_Occupation_desc:0 "It seems unlikely that the Germans would be satisfied with simply keeping the current borders with France untouched. A compromise needs to be made, allowing the continued occupation of the previously demilitarised province of Lorraine by German forces. Britain will approve of the Lorraine occupation for at least 100 years, unless Germany decides to relinquish its control over the territory in the future."
  PB_CoE_A_Jewish_Homeland:0 "Discuss a Jewish Homeland"
  PB_CoE_A_Jewish_Homeland_desc:0 "The Jewish people have suffered immensely under the French regime, seeing insane forms of persecution. While a rather unorthodox proposal, a few German diplomats have proposed to grant the Jewish people a part of France as repayment for the unethical and immoral projects targetting French jews of the former French government."
  PB_CoE_GER_choose_place_for_israel:0 "Pick [FROM.GetName] as Jewish Homeland"

  COE.1.t:0 "Conference of Europe: The Main Course"
  COE.1.d:0 "As diplomats and heads of government and state gather around the packed hallways of Het Loo Palace, so graciously proposed to be the site of this historical conference by the Dutch crown, the conference slowly gets started. In a sideroom, not that noticeable when walking through the palace, the major players have started the conference with its main course: France. \n\nThe undoubted aggressor of this war, France acts like a mirror for many older diplomats in the room, reflecting upon the hasty decisions made in the aftermath of the first Great War that allowed for such a monster like Doriot to firmly grasp the wheel of the failed Republic. Among British diplomats, who seek to find an eternal solution to the continent's war problem, the old treaty is the perfect example of how not to go forward. Germany, on the other hand, has been the nation that suffered the most from the French invasion, with their border regions destroyed and their economy turned on its head after such an expensive war. Millions of marks in debt and the lives of many men lost, Germany's diplomats resent the British approach to the situation. In their eyes, the solution to France is clear: dismantlement. The degrees vary, but most German diplomats are keen on the idea of breaking the French spirit completely. \n\nAs papers are put on the round table and the big faces of Europe start speaking, the Conference of Europe has truly started."
  COE.1.a:0 "Hopefully, peace will be given a chance"
  COE.2.t:0 "Conference of Europe: The Dexter Plan"
  COE.2.d:0 "Drawn up and proposed by famed Commonwealth economists Harry Dexter White and Henry Morgenthau, the Dexter Plan reeks of British influence. Proposing to minimize the partition of France, the Dexter Plan draws up a map of the pre-expansion borders of France, excluding the region around Dunkerque, which is given to Wallonian state. The plan further details several industrial occupation zones across the country, mainly meant to keep France's heavy industrial capabilities under the watchful eyes of the League of Nations. \n\nWhile a subtle and highly technical plan that promises peace on the continent, the German diplomats have been far less enthusiastic about the proposed plan than their British counterparts. Perhaps the plan can use some revision, but it is currently the proposal we put on the table."
  COE.2.a:0 "Let the vote begin..."

  COEDEX.1.t:0 "The Discussion of a Jewish Homeland"
  COEDEX.1.d:0 "As British diplomats seek to further placate us with their Dexter Plan, the proposal of German diplomats to carve some territory away from France and give it to the Jewish people has been given the green light by the Brits. The Jewish people have suffered immensely under the French dictatorship, seeing themselves stripped from citizenship, property and sometimes their lives. The least we can do is come together and repay the Jewish people, a globally persecuted people, with their own homeland in France. \n\nThe question now remains which French state to grant the Jewish people. Preferably, the territory has a coast and isn't already claimed by another country."
