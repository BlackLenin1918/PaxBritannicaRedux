waroutcome.15.t:0 "The Future of Spain"
waroutcome.15.d:0 "With victory over the Spanish crusader state, it has become clear to our administrators that Spain has suffered the last few decades for want of a sovereign. Obviously the Bourbon dynasty which ruled before the Great War is out of consideration, which naturally leaves two obvious solutions. We can install a monarch from the British house of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, or we can install a monarch from the House of Habsburg.\n\nBoth bring with them the natural political inclinations of their home country, with the Windsorite proposal citing the need for Spanish autonomism in the same model as the Imperial Confederation. The Habsburg proposal is more conservative, arguing for a federative Spanish kingdom with limited autonomy for the country's minority regions. The natural historical implications of returning Spain to the bosom of Vienna is fairly obvious, of course.\n\nRegardless of the decision, the League has a golden opportunity to capitalize on Spain's weariness to create a compliant nation and establish control over a critical instrument in rebuilding the European concert."
