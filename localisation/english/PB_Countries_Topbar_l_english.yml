  ENG_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe United Kingdom§! is the dominant world power in 1933.\n\n A victor in the Great War, Britain retreated into isolationism with the postwar §Y"Long Depression"§! that gripped the global economy. Propping itself up with inter-empire trade, the United Kingdom and her §YImperial Confederation§! have weathered the storm of the interwar relatively unscathed. However, vast speculation bubbles, unstable currency and growing global discontent threaten to undermine Britain's Empire, particularly as tensions continue to rise with the up-and-coming §YAmerican Commonwealth§!.\n\n The United Kingdom now faces threats from a resurgent France and Russia, eager to settle the score from the Great War, as well as conflict within their increasingly precarious Empire and the nation itself.\n\n The United Kingdom is a §YGreat Power§!.\n\n"
  AME_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Commonwealth of America§! is the dominant North American power in 1933 and the seat of British Imperial authority on the continent. \n\n Having gained a modicum of independence via the §YGalloway Plan of Union§!, the American Commonwealth has been the right hand of the British Empire for more than a century. \n\n The Commonwealth was the model upon which the system of §YConstituent Commonwealths§! was established, retaining near total independence save for foreign affairs. Though relatively peaceful, the nation's role as the peacekeeper of North America has seen it clash with its' own Southern slave-owning class in the §Y Southern Rebellion§! of the 1800s. Even now, the issue of civil rights is a principle problem for the nation because of the inconsistent segregation laws. \n\n In the years since the Great War, wherein the Commonwealth fought and bled under their own flag for the first time during the Iberian Campaign, America has begun to grow beyond London's dictates. In many ways a §YGreat Power§! in its' own right, the Commonwealth effectively holds Great Britain's import reliant economy hostage at the §YImperial Parliament§!, fostering no small amount of resentment among Britain's imperial elites. With the archaic and contradictory Confederation beginning to seem less and less valuable, the American Commonwealth may soon be in a position to become the master of its' own empire. \n\n The Commonwealth of America is a §YGreat Power§!."
  JAP_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Republic of Japan§! is a growing power in East Asia in 1933. \n\n Japan was one of the few nations of Asia to survive the wave of colonialist expansion relatively unmolested. Following a period of intense isolationism, Japan began to open up to Western trade in the mid 1800s with the arrival of French and Dutch trade delegations. Fearing that a failure to modernize might see their nation subjected to the same fate as Imperial China, Japan adopted a series of radical reforms under Emperor Meiji. This period, known as the §YMeiji Restoration§!, saw Japan dramatically modernize and even contest the power of the once unassailable Chinese Empire. \n\n The rising sun, however, fell just as quickly as it ascended. The §YFar Eastern Crisis§! of 1905 saw the outbreak of war between Japan and Russia over influence in Korea and Manchuria. The initially local conflict soon became the spark that lit the powderkeg of the §YGreat War§!. Japan found itself quickly outclassed by the introduction of the British and German navies, leading to a two year long blockade and the ultimate collapse of Japanese operations in continental Asia. Ultimately, Emperor Meiji would see the very empire he helped create collapse in 1909 with the §YTokyo Garrison Rebellion§!. \n\n Spurred by riots over rationing and austerity measures, elements of the Imperial Japanese Army rebelled against the government after orders to break up the protests. Unwilling to murder their compatriots, the IJA turned on their commanders and fired the first shots of §Ythe Japanese Civil War§!. In the ensuing chaos, a provisional democratic government ascended to power alongside the growing Jacobin movement. The conflict saw the burning of the Imperial Palace, armistice with the §YImperial Powers§!, and ultimately the seizure of power by the radical Jacobins of the provisional government. In the ensuing years, Jacobin leadership lead a bloody §YRepublican Terror§!, executing or imprisoning thousands of citizens for supposed imperial sympathies. §YKingoro Hashimoto§! would ascend to power after the overthrow of the Diet in 1911, notable for his defection to the provisional government after the Tokyo Rebellion. Suspending elections with emergency powers, Hashimoto rules Japan as the so-called protector of the revolution. With resurgent Russian expansionism and China on the verge of collapse, Japan now stands poised to lead the people's revolution across Asia and beyond."
  CHI_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Empire of China§! is an empire in decline in 1933\n\nOfficially the Empire of Great Qing, the Manchu-led Chinese state has been in almost constant decline since the first arrival of Europeans. Following the §YManchu Conquest of China§!, the Qing stood as a dominant power in Asia, however decades of mismanagement and isolationism crippled their ability to project power. This would be further exacerbated with the arrival of British interests in the region and, more importantly, the §YOpium Trade§!.\n\nOpium became a major problem throughout the Empire and soon the Qing were forced to act. They began seizing and destroying Opium shipments, a decision that would set them down the path towards the §YFirst Opium War§!. Decisively defeated, the Qing were left humiliated and forced into a series of unequal treaties, effectively carving whole swathes of China into §YSPheres of Influence§!. Peking was unable to catch a break with the rise of Japan as a superpower, and would ultimately lose influence over Korea following a brief conflict. Broken, both militarily and financially, the Qing retreated into a state of isolationism, only able to issue a quiet protest when Manchuria became a battleground during the §YGreat War§!\n\nThe §YInterwar§! years have not been kind to the moribund imperial state. The streets of the Dali and Guangzhou burn with the fires of young revolution, while in the West, the Khans and Uyghurs plot their independence. The greatest threat has come with the rise of the §YNational Revolutionary Alliance§!, a broad underground coalition of nationalists, jacobins and reformists bent on overthrowing the monarchy. Even the allegiance of the military has come into question, as local governors have carved out their provinces into regionalist warlord states just itching to break free. Banditry runs amok, people are starving, the coffers are empty. The Qing Empire is on life support, and it's just a matter of time before the plug is pulled."
