 PB_Anarchy_wild_west_tt_delayed: "Something is out there, amongst the cold skies of the Great American plains. Little is known about those who live there and even less about the states that call these lands home. While trade and infrastructure networks have long been established, little effort has been made to civilise these lands. However, recent attempts by the United Commonwealth and the remnants of the Mexican Empire have been semi-successful in mapping out the last bastion of the American Wild West. But some would rather not poke around to see what sleeping giant comes running out, if any that is.\n\n§RIt's a wild world out there, and it's best if it's left that way.§!"
