PB_Culture_English_tt_delayed:0 "The English culture reaches from the cold skies of the British Isles to the almost blizzard like terrain of the north American winter lands, to the artificial lakes of Africa and beyond it seems nowhere in the world is there not at least one fine English gentleman parading across the street. While English culture has remained largely true to its early 19th century form noticeable changes have emerged. Namely the quick progression into more liberalistic beliefs, and a strange yet captivating interest into indoor domestic life; this can be attributed to the beginnings of the multilevel structure of London that has slowly spread across the English countryside. If one was to define the modern English man in only a few words, then there would be none better to choose from than civilized and sophisticated."
PB_Culture_Scottish_tt_delayed:0 "The Scottish people are one of hard work, dedication, and patriotism. Their valiant efforts in the First Great War have never gone unseen by the British nobility, serving proudly amongst their English and Irish Brethren during Operation Overlord. However, not everything is sunshine and rainbows, the Scottish people have longed for an independent homeland ever since the unification of Great Britain. Whilst there have not been any relatively major attempts at succession from Imperial Britain all it would take is for London to push the Scots far enough for their tamed patriotism to alight once more."

PB_Culture_Breton_tt_delayed:0 "To the northwest of France the last Celts in mainland Europe dwell.  After hundreds of years of forced homogeneity with the French, the Bretons gained their independence after the French surrendered and with that formed a second Breton state.  The Bretons are currently going through a cultural renaissance; with the Breton language seeing a record number of speakers and new art and literature coming from the peninsula, it seems the last mainland Celts have finally secured their existence.  However, the neo-imperialist government to their southeast has been threatening them as of late, and with French revanchism on the rise, some can’t help but think the Breton renaissance’s days are numbered."
PB_Culture_French_tt_delayed:0 ""
PB_Culture_Occitan_tt_delayed:0 "For hundreds of years, the Occitan people have suffered persecution and forced integration with their French rulers.  From the Albigensian Crusade to the founding of France’s neo-imperialist government, the Occitans have dealt with much.  However, this has not shattered their spirit; they continue on with their long-lasting traditions and unique Mediterranean language, keeping the Occitan torch held high amongst the darkness of French chauvinism.  They refused to be silenced, and as such provide plenty of problems for France’s governing neo-imperialists in the form of light armed resistance and protests.  Even then, some have found shelter from the revanchists in Catalonia, Italy, and Algeria, meaning even if the French manage to win, the Occitans will live on forever."

Even discovering many places such as Australia, New Zealand and more. Not only are they a people of conquering, but also of mercantilism, trade, birthplace of modern capitalism, and the founding place of the first ever Republic, which has forever changed the political landscape on the European continent. Although the republic did not last, the people now have a strong royal family, colonial empire and a very distinct liberal identity as a people"

PB_Culture_Wallonian_tt_delayed:0 "Although the population largely speaks French, the culture is far straying from that of French culture. It can be best described as mitch match of French, German and Dutch culture, and some parts even having some Luxembourgian culture. Having gained their independence quite recently in 1910 after the Great War, the country was in ruins, but the people of Wallonia managed to not only rebuild the country, but also foster unity amongst there newly independent citizens. The creation of the Wallonian state can be credited to the governments of the imperial powers, who the idea of a buffer state between both France and the Netherlands. They are also the reason that Walloon is the only official language in the country, which was achieved through their anti-French agenda. The people are known too be very friendly, mercantile and most helpful when it comes to most things."

Having moved east as part of the old Ostsiedlung phenomenon, in which German settlers moved east from central Germany during the Middle Ages, the Sudeten Germans are a populous minority in Bohemia, making up 23% of the population in the region.  With them they brought the German language and culture, making the mountains their home.  The Sudeten Germans are a point of contention between nationalists, with German nationalists supporting the integration of the Sudetenland into Germany proper, and Czech and pan-Slavic nationalists supporting their expulsion from the mountains.  Either way, they’ve lived in the mountains for hundreds of years - they doubt anybody will be able to take their homes from them."

Southern-Italian food, such as the famous pizza and many types of pasta, are popular not only in Naples but all over the world as well.  Beyond food, Southern-Italians are known for their adherence to Catholicism, their folk music, and organized crime via the Italian Mafia which operates heavily in southern Italy.  Southern-Italians value family and community above all - which is where their love for food and music comes from.  Anything that can bring the family - or town - together is valued by Southern-Italians.  Architecture is also important to Southern-Italians, as their Mediterranean buildings influenced by Greeks and North Africans are iconic to the region."
PB_Culture_Sardinian_tt_delayed:0 "The island of Sardinia used to be populated an unknown civilisation sometime before the Roman Empire, which are known to have created the very well made Nuraghes, which are still standing today. Because of the things that were found in their ruins, there are several holidays, festivities and other activities that were created in their honour. Although not much remains of the Sardinian language, it is still spoken by the older population and is still taught in smaller circles. Sardinia although a very formal part of Italy, has some autonomy which allows the island to keep its traditions and culture. The people there are known to be very relaxed, rough and not to bothered by continental affairs"

# IBERIA #

PB_Culture_Spanish_tt_delayed:0 "The Spanish have been everywhere, from the Americas to the Philippines, and as such their culture is very well one of the most famous.  The food, the art, the music, the traditions - all of which are associated with one of Europe’s most interesting and international cultures in the world.  One cannot associate Spain without thinking of its many fames, such as paella and classical guitar.  One of its most important aspects, Catholicism, has become so important that it has an actual place in Spain’s government.  In a wave of theocracy and neo-imperialism, most of Iberia, the Spanish included, embraced the place of their God in everyday government.  Religion has played larger and larger roles with the outbreak of Carlism in the nineteenth century to the modern day, and while other groups amongst the Spanish resist, it seems they’re the main force behind the ultimate Christianization of Iberia."
PB_Culture_Portuguese_tt_delayed:0 "The Portuguese are a people of adventure and trade.  As once the owners of one of Europe’s largest colonial empires, and having influence all over the globe until recently in modern history, much of what the Portuguese discovered about the world around them has not been forgotten.  Their influence was so wide-reaching that the Lusophone world lives from Brazil to southern Africa, where Portuguese speakers reside.  Political instability has made its way to the Portuguese, with a failed monarchy giving way to Portugal’s modern theocracy based on its long-standing religious nature, much like their Spanish brethren to the east.  Whether this regime will last - and if the Portuguese people truly desire theocracy - still stands to be questioned, but it seems finally the Portuguese have found their political niche."
PB_Culture_Galician_tt_delayed:0 "Some consider the Galicians a Romance people while others consider them Celtic - either way, the Galicians are a proud people with centuries of rich history.  As they had one of the original crusader states in northern Iberia, Galicians went on to found Portugal and resisted control from Castile until they imposed a Santa Hermandad occupation on the region.  Since then, Galicia has been stuck in-between two claimants, the Spanish and the Portuguese, in which the region has changed hands multiple times over the course of centuries.  The Galician culture is rich in art, song, and traditions, especially with the Celtic revival that occurred in the mid-nineteenth century, and tend not to follow nationalist or neo-imperialist ideals as closely as other groups in Iberia do."
PB_Culture_Catalan_tt_delayed:0 "For a thousand years, the Catalan people have been one of Iberia’s most important groups of people.  Participating in the Reconquista and founding their own empire - Aragon - in the early centuries of the second millennium, the Catalans enjoyed their place at Iberia’s table of important nations.  All of that changed after the Union of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon, and the Catalans have been sidelined by the Spanish ever since.  As such, this is translated into frequent rebellions against the Spanish - some in nationalist nature, some political - and Catalonia has seen much strife, especially with the advent of nationalism in the early nineteenth century and neo-imperialism in the early twentieth.  They continue to fight to this day for independence, though their uprisings are piecemeal."
PB_Culture_Basque_tt_delayed:0 "The Basque people are truly unique, with a language and customs that can’t be traced to any ancestor.  They’ve inhabited the Basque Country, a territory from northern Iberia to southwestern France, for millennia, and are historically one of Iberia’s most religious regions.  They share a history of militant nationalism and religiousness, fighting wars of independence and regime change against Spain for centuries.  They famously joined the Second Carlist War because of the loss of their special autonomous privileges and to establish a traditionalist, almost theocratic monarchy in Spain.  In a twist of fate, they have escaped the Spanish theocracy and formed their own Basque state - but with a traditionalist Spanish to their south and an expansionist France to their north, they’re in-between a rock and a hard place."
PB_Culture_Asturian_tt_delayed:0 ""
PB_Culture_Andalusian_tt_delayed:0 "Andalusian culture, despite its minority within the Iberian peninsula, has largely created much of Spain’s modern cultural hallmarks - from flamenco to bullfighting, and even the musical chord progression named after them, the Andalusian cadence -  the Andalusian people have been incredibly influential to not only Iberian culture but the world’s perception of it.  Modern Andalusian culture developed after the Reconquista and has since dominated southern Spain from Huelva to Cartagena.  Unlike the Catalans or Basques to the north, Andalusian nationalism isn’t nearly as popular, and as such many consider Andalusia to be a core part of Spain.  However, there are still some calls for autonomy for Andalusia - but any notion of independence is usually only shared by staunch nationalists."

# BALKANS #

PB_Culture_Hellenic_tt_delayed:0 "Hailing from the times of Homer and Alexander the Great, the Hellenic people are occupants of this grand hall to humanity's monuments known as the Greek peninsula. From the wonders of democracy to the magic of mathematics, the Greeks brought much to the modern world, upon which the rest of Europe was build on. After our achievements of greatness during the Hellenistic era, the Romans came and gave us another shot at might, birthing Byzantium out of the corpse of Rome. Byzantium rose and Byzantium fell, turning the great inventors and philosophers into subjects of the Turkish sultan.\n\nSince our independence, Greek identity has been defined by a similar struggle of national self-governance as the rest of the Balkans. Greeks deserve a Greek government, yet many Hellenes are still outside of Greece's borders, subject to oppressors not unlike the sultan. Baked into the same ethno-linguistic roots as most other European identities, Greek identity is about championing the return of all Greeks under a Greek government. From Epirus to Thrace and Cyprus to Anatolia, it is all Greek to us."
PB_Culture_Albanian_tt_delayed:0 "The mountains of this land house a peculiar people, formed into a unique community, unlike any other culture in the Balkan. Defined by their code of honour, their religious tolerance and their struggle for independence, the Albanian people remain a product of history, both its independent past as its occupied past. No symbol symbolises this better than the black, double-headed eagle on the Albanian flag, the embodiment of Albania's valour and independence.\n\nAlbanian culture is divided along north-south lines linguistically, with the north housing the Gheg, while the south is dominated by the Tosk. Despite centralisation efforts under the kingdom, no single dialect has been chosen as a standardised version of Albanian. Through its languages and oral tradition, Albanians preserved a unique system of honour, known as Kanun. Central to Kanun is Besa (to keep one's word) and Nderi (honour). Language, independence and a culture of honour is perhaps the shortest summary of what unifies this peculiar people of the Western Balkan."
PB_Culture_Slovenian_tt_delayed:0 "Slovenian identity, like many notions of nations, came to the region in the form of the protestant reformation, when bibles and religious texts were translated into Slovenian. From there, the enlightenment emboldened intellectuals, who saw the distinct language and folklore of the Alpine Slavic people as clearly Slovenian, more influenced by Austrian, German and Italian ideas than the Russian and Turkish influenced Croatians, Bulgarians and Serbians. Under the German government, Slovenians were able to keep a hold on their unique regional identity, forming a periphery of the German empire that showed the Slavic roots of the border region.\n\nThe rich list of Slovenian folklore and symbols reinforce its independence from both Germanic and Slavic cultures. Ranging from the mythic Goldhorn to Grohar's \"The Sower\", depicting the idyllic Slovenian countryside, Slovenian culture remains a mix of its rural and medieval traditions, tied to the regions of Carniola and Carantania, and the enlightenment's focus on linguistics and literature, leading to the adoption of a common identity, justified by loose threads of history."

PB_Culture_Dalmatian_tt_delayed:0 "A mix of Croatian and Italian culture, the Dalmatians (or more commonly known as Fetivi) are a distinct group of people inhabiting the Dalmatian coast. Differing from the Croats of the Hinterland, who are closer to the Bosnian-Croats, the Dalmatian people are the historical product of decades of Venetian occupation, trade and culture. In the 20th century, this influence has waned, but it remains ever present in the fact that most Dalmatians still speak Italian, per chance by the limited attempts of centralisation during Croatia's short time as an independent nation.\n\nThe Italian cultural influence is also seen in Dalmatian architecture, far more distinctly Mediterranean than Slavic. Even the Croatian cuisine seems absent in many of Dalmatia's coastal cities, replaced by Italian dishes with a hint of a Slavic twist to them. Religiously, the Fetivi don't clash too much with Croatian Catholicism, practising Catholicism as well, though often following the words of the Vatican more closely than those of the Hinterland or Zagreb."

PB_Culture_Hungarian_tt_delayed:0 "A culture distinct from the rest of the Balkans and perhaps even most of Europe, the Hungarian people can find their roots in the nomadic people that settled the Pannonian plains, hailing initially from the Pontic steppes. Distinct in their heritage, the Hungarian people founded a culture initially different from the rest of Europe, but soon assimilated through their adoption of christianity and their frequent contact with the German statelets and Slavic cultures of Eastern Europe. Yet they remained different.\n\nA culture so defined by its history, remaining independent as a state for decades, stays true to its roots as a christian and Magyar nation. When looking around the countryside, folk music, stories and clothing still reflect upon our ancient age. In the great city of Budapest, memories of medieval times remain in the architecture and arts. Even when the revolution came, the people remain close to their past and a sense of pride and community highlights that most clearly." 
PB_Culture_Slovakian_tt_delayed:0 "" 
PB_Culture_Ruthenian_tt_delayed:0 "An elusive people that call the eastern Carpathians their home, the Ruthenians have a complex origin even for Slavic standards, though it is assumed that they're mainly descendants of the early Slavic tribe known as the White Croats. Mainly under the thumb of the Hungarians for over centuries, Ruthenia, despite its provincial and rural geography, turned into a collective centre of an Ukrainian Renaissance in the 19th century, together with Polish Halychyna.\n\nDespite their ties to the Ukrainian lands, the Ruthenian people are still distinct from the rest of Ukraine. Following the teachings of the Eastern Catholic Church and speaking in a dialect that is hard to understand for Ukrainians and Russians, the provincial status of Ruthenians has clearly divided them from the rest of Ukraine. However, it remains to be seen if these people, having survived since the medieval ages and all of its persecution, can continue their Ukrainian Renaissance. Hungarian and Russian attempts to crack down on Eastern Catholicism and the regional dialect continue and the Ruthenian people suffer for their unique identity."

PB_Culture_Amazonian_tt_delayed:0 "Amazonian is used as an umbrella term to group all native people of the Amazon basin. Despite wildly different cultures, religions and politics, these tribes still share a common history in their struggle against Brazilian colonisation. When Brazil still stood tall and rubber production caught up, the Amazonian people were giving an early warning what could have been, with Brazilian peasants working on large plantations, often at odds with the natives due to land conflicts. \n\nThe collapse of Brazil put a long, fortunate end to this. The natives, warned about the intents of the Brazilians, saw to reorganise themselves better. Amazonian culture underwent decades of development in the span of years, forced to as the threat of the white man's greed remained ever present."
PB_Culture_Argentine_tt_delayed:0 "Argentina is a nation as multi-ethnic as many of its neighbours, consisting of a distinct mix of European immigrants and the native populations. Yet, despite its similairities, Argentinean identity is unlike many other South American communities as it remains tied to the idea of Argentina as a nation of immigrants \"bajados de los barcos\" (straight off the boat). The constitution even recognises this idea of Argentina, with article 25 encouraging European immigration and separating it from undesireable non-European immigration. This has led to a cultural blend of Italian, Spanish, Germanic and British, among a few other minority cultures, which defines Argentina as a nation of European immigrants."
PB_Culture_Bolivian_tt_delayed:0 ""
PB_Culture_Brazilian_tt_delayed:0 "Brazilian is an odd concept in our current day and age. As the old Empire of Brazil fell, so did the idea of being Brazilian partially. In the north of former Brazil, a new identity sprung up with Equatorilian, while the south saw itself assimilate into a larger, Cisplatine identity. Nevertheless, Brazilian culture, defined by its unique Portuguese roots, remains. \n\nRejecting the ethnic nationalism popularised during the 19th century in favour of an identity based on loyalty to Brazil as a concept, it is no wonder that much of Brazil's population is triracial to some degree. Still, racism against Brazil's non-white population is prevelent, though not institutionalised. \"Whitening\" remains a soft policy on the local level and European racial sciences have become more popular among the white elite of Brazil after the failure of the Empire."
PB_Culture_Chilean_tt_delayed:0 "One word has come to symbolize the Chilean spirit: Roto. Once used as a classist insult to mock the poverty of the Chilean people, Roto has become this idea of the common Chilean man fighting for his nation, how impoverished he may be. A fighting spirit, born out of the desperate survival of the Chilean people for the right to exist. \n\nSince Chilean losses during the War of the Pacific and the military juntas that consistently succeeded eachother, Chilean culture has put an emphasis on its Hispanic and catholic roots. Practices with their roots in native cultures have become unchilean through decades of repression and popularizing of pseudosciences."
PB_Culture_Cisplatine_tt_delayed:0 "Emerging from the May Revolution during the war of independence, the Cisplatine people's \"League of the Free Peoples\", once a bastion against centralism, turned into a community of South Americans inspired by the revolutionary democratic ideals that tore Europe apart in the 19th century. \n\nSince then, Cisplatina has been heavily influenced through the Italian immigrants coming to the Rio de la Plata. The language, known as Cisplatina Castillian, generally sounds like Spanish with an Italian accent, unique from the native-Hispanic mix of the Andean and the more German-rooted Argentinean dialect. Beyond the language, the Italian inspiration is also seen in the cuisine, which mixes the beef-heavy Hispanic classics with staple Italian choices, such as pasta. It is perhaps this mix of Italian and Hispanic cultures that make Cisplatina the only professional football nation of the Southern hemisphere."
PB_Culture_Colombian_tt_delayed:0 "To be Colombian in this modern world is a synonym for being traditional. While the majority of the country remains mestizo, a mix of European and indigenous Americans, the white elite continues the tradition of the colonial criollos through dominating the political structure of the country. While it may not have been the intention of Bolivar when he created his Gran Colombia, the criollos surely didn't mind abusing the power vacuum after his death and propped themselves up. \n\nIn modern times, Colombia remains a multiracial nation of people that identify being Colombian as an allegiance to the country instead of an ethnic background tied to the country, yet inequality still reigns in these jungles. While white Colombians enjoy the wine of the land, the rest of the population toils and picks the grapes for them."
PB_Culture_Colombo_Amazonian_tt_delayed:0 "Colozonian (shortened for Colombo-Amazonian) is a weird periphery of two cultures clashing heavily as one in the region. Native Amazonians and Colombians have had a troublesome relationship, as peasants often clash with natives over land. However, after decades of Colombian rule, Amazonian natives and Colombian peasants have started to combine into a separate mestizo group. Uniquely rural, in touch with their roots and sometimes even syncretic with their beliefs, Colozonian culture has not been respected in the European-dominated society of Gran Colombia."
PB_Culture_Ecuadorian_tt_delayed:0 "To define what is Ecuadorian is rather easy: namely, everything that isn't Colombian. While the idea of Ecuador as an imagined community of people started with the failed revolutions during the Wars of Independence, Ecuadorian identity still was able to be fostered during its years under Bogota rule. A periphery of the empire, Ecuador came to define itself staunchly as anti-Colombian. \n\nParts of this anti-Colombian attitude is translated into a liberal and unorthodox people. The rigid racial hierarchy of Colombia is rejected in favour of a more dynamic understanding of white, mestizo and black. Combining physical appearance with social class, geography, language and clothing, Ecuadorian understanding of race starkly contrasts with Colombia's rigid definitions. Still, despite this relaxed approach to race and a few other things, Ecuador's population remains faithful christians and at least a bit conservative."
PB_Culture_Equatorial_tt_delayed:0 "Born from the rich and distinct culture, dialect and history of Nordeste, Equatorilian resembles a more distinct mix of African, native American and European cultures than other parts of Brazil, partially due to its important role in Brazil's slavery history. \n\nWith the dissolution of Brazil, local pride or bairrismo, formed the basis for an identity separate from Brazilian. As Brazilian identity became more enthralled with European culture, the Nordeste preserved its unique melting pot characteristic. From Maracatu to Vatapá, Nordeste is proud to have the cultural dynamic it has today."
PB_Culture_Guyanese_tt_delayed:0 "Guyanese culture is defined by its history as a British colony. Once founded to be the sugarcane plantation of the Empire, Guyana's demographics changed rapidly throughout the 16th and 17th century, as African slaves were imported into Georgetown. When slavery was abolished, the people of Guyana were left as a mix of Afro-Guyanese, Amerindians, Europeans and a handful of Bengali workers. \n\nWhile Georgetown in the 19th century was a predominantly European city, the 20th century saw the rise of a black middle class in the city, defining its theatre, music and literature. Today, Guyana's culture defines itself in its stark contrasts: its history of slavery, the poverty many still endure and the struggles of Afro-Guyanese people and their place in the Empire."
PB_Culture_Mapuche_tt_delayed:0 "The history of the Mapuche people is one of conflict. When the Spanish came to the Americas, the traditional lifestyle of the Mapuche was interrupted through brutal conquest of the Patagonian plains. While intermingling with the Spanish and giving form to a mestizo population in Argentine, the Mapuche remained on tense footing with an independent Argentine and Chile. Eventually, concepts of Manifest Destiny led to the expelling of the Mapuche people from the Pampas and to the southern tip of Patagonia, mirroring the American maltreatment of the native Indians. \n\nToday, Mapuche society has modernised with a rapid pace. The Ethiopia of Patagonia, the Mapuche have become ready to defend their current homes from further Latin-American encroachment."
PB_Culture_Paraguayan_tt_delayed:0 "Paraguayan culture is defined by two main characteristics: its close connections to the Guaraní people and its constant struggle to survive as a community of people. \n\nBorn out of local rivalry between Asunción and Buenos Aires, Paraguayan history is one of consistent invasion and survival. Today, with half of the nation occupied by Bolivian forces, Paraguay remains a shining beacon, reminding its people across the border that the motherland remains to spite Chaco. \n\nDespite historical bagage, Paraguayan culture is still flowery. Embroidery and lace making decorate the traditional clothing of the people, while you can taste the locality in every Paraguayan dish. Native influences remain prevelant in literature, music and theatre."
PB_Culture_Peruvian_tt_delayed:0 "The rugged Andes mountains house the spirit of Peru as a nation. Divided by deep valleys and high mountains, Hispanic and native culture coexists. Perhaps more so than any other South American culture, Peruvian culture is syncretized with native cultures, creating an unique culture of European ideas with native American twists. From the literature, music, traditional clothing, dances and architecture, Peru embraces its relationship between communities, despite its dark colonial past."
PB_Culture_Quechua_tt_delayed:0 "Quechua is a general, catch-all term for a large group of Andean natives that speak Quechua languages. Finding its roots in the Inca Empire and its neighbours, the Quechua people are most prominent in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, countries where the number of Quechua speakers are in the millions. \n\nWhile clearly distinct from each other, the Spanish dominance in the South American states has given rise to Quechua nation-building, forming a more collective and united identity consciousness around the native speakers of Quechua and their struggle against Hispanic supremacy."

PB_Culture_Suriname_tt_delayed:0 "Defined throughout centuries of Dutch colonialism, Suriname consists of Indian, Indonesian, Creole, African, Amerindian, Chinese and European people, directly impacting the culture of the region. With many of the non-European and native population imported as a cheap labour force for the countless plantations of the colony to the point that they now form a majority of Surinamese people, Suriname's cultural identity is influenced by the history of slavery. Non-European literature often touches on the history and brutality of Suriname's plantations. \n\nSince the end of slavery, Suriname's non-European population still experience extreme poverty under a system of European rule. While talks of self-government are present, it remains to be seen if the proposals are picked up by the government in Amsterdam."

PB_Culture_Acadiana_French_tt_delayed:0 "Previously the name used for the French settlers of the Canadian maritime provinces in the 16th century, the term Acadian changed with the expulsion and subsequent ethnic cleansing of the region during British rule. Since then, the term Acadian has come to mean a Francophone inhabitant of the Greater Louisiana region, once France's most formidable colony in the New World. \n\nDespite local autonomy, the Acadian people remain repressed under Anglo supremacist laws, forbiding the use of French in government and other public spaces. Despite this official ban on the language, Acadia's cultural life remains brimming with French influence, as its music and theatre mix the newest fashions from metropolitan France with the local cultures of the mixed Creoles. Especially in its cuisine, deeply rooted in Occitan and French traditions, Acadia stubbornly refuses to bend the knee to the British."

PB_Culture_Nortemexicano_tt_delayed:0 "Defined by the rough frontiers of Mexico's borders, the Nortemexicano culture is a seperate identity from the people that live in Mexico City. Instead of the luxurious, European-inspired lifestyle down in Mexico, the Nortemexicano's mainly live via their ranches and the small communities that dot the deserts and plains of the region. Vaqueros dominate these plains with their hardened world-views, going through life on their own and only their faith to fall back upon. \n\nNortemexicano is also defined by the same stark racial differences as in Southern Mexico, with the big ranches owned by an elite of purely European Mexicans, while the vaqueros are disproportionally men of mestizo origin. Only in a few places, such as California or Santa Fe, are the ranches also owned by mestizo and even native people."
PB_Culture_Old_Dixie_tt_delayed:0 "Below the Mason-Dixon line lays the old South, once the beating heart of the Thirteen colonies when cotton made America into what it was. Remaining somewhat loyal to the Brits, Dixie would turn into a limited centre of power for the Commonwealth directly after the Revolution. Yet, good things rarely last and the abolishment of slavery, together with the industrial revolution rocking New England, led to the gradual decline into poverty of the Deep South. The big plantation houses are stark reminders of the past, monuments to the old landed elite of Dixie, who have lost any semblance of a colonial elite. \n\nDespite its losses, Dixie preserves its unique culture from the rest of the United States through the protection of its local cuisine, its rich selection of writers and the promotion of country and gospel music. Through the lense of the rest of America, Dixie is a land of many traits, both its \"souther hospitality\" and its more controversial racial notions. Especially the last trait has become problematic in recent years, as the Commonwealth government and its British allies make more and more steps towards liberalisation and equality. Few in Dixie don't share the anxiety that their Southern way of life may soon be under attack, though few would prefer to make clear which part of that life they mean."
PB_Culture_Quebecois_tt_delayed:0 ""
PB_Culture_Seminole_tt_delayed:0 "The story of the Seminole is one present among a few tribes on the Americas, making it rather powerful in the grand history of the continent. When the Europeans came, the Seminole people were decimated by European sickness, yet persevered and build up a strong community of people thriving on Floridian farmlands. When the Anglo settlers came, the Seminole, backed by African slaves who had made Florida their home, turned the tide and made peace with the Commonwealth, turning Florida into the only native-majority state of the entire Commonwealth. \n\nDespite the political odds stacked against the Seminole people, its culture remains intact. Important events like the Green Corn Dance are celebrated state-wide, while tobacco has been granted a special religious status, exempting it from federal law and taxes. Through hardship and Goliath-like odds, the Seminole have been able to survive."
PB_Culture_Tejano_American_tt_delayed:0 "Texan or Tejano American describes the community of English speaking settlers in the Republic of Tejas, sons and daughters of previous American pioneers who now dominate the plains of Eastern Tejas. Rooted deeply in their freedom-loving and god-fearing culture, the Texans have been a vocal minority in the Tejas Republic, often heavily clashing with the big Hispanic landowners of the West. \n\nWith a culture heavily rooted in the old pioneers and a fascination with the tales of American heroes braving the uncivilized regions of this continent, the Texans are as \"folk\" as you can get in Tejas. Through their unique gun culture, prosperous ranches and semi-isolation from San Antonio, the Texans have been able to preserve their autonomy for quite some time at this point. Through their autonomy, these white protestants have basically formed a nation within our nation, one characterized by a \"free-and-fighting\" spirit and a rooted hatred for anything Mexican or catholic."
