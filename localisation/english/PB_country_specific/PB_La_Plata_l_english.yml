  PB_ARG_Italian_Heritage:0 "Our Italian Heritage"
  PB_ARG_Italian_Heritage_desc:0 "When Amadeo di Savoia, the Duke of Aosta, accepted the title of King of Argentina from the Argentinian Regency Council in 1870, immigrants began flocking to Argentina from Italy in droves over the decades. These immigrants, spurred on by the idea of a vast land where they could be free of the wars that seemingly raged endlessly across Italy, have long since imprinted their ideals, values, heritage, and culture upon this nation. Italian is the second-most spoken language in Argentina behind Spanish itself, signs read in both languages, the tango is danced to Italian folk music, and asado is eaten with a side of Italian wine. Even still, more and Italians leave their homeland in search of a better life in Argentina, especially during and after the Great War, and most recently, the Italian Civil War. With the combination of the partial mutual intelligibility of Spanish and Italian combined with the vast amount of Italian immigrants, Italian culture has settled in well and woven itself deeply into the Argentine identity."

  PB_ARG_Agrarian_Economy:0 "The Agrarian Economy"
  PB_ARG_Agrarian_Economy_desc:0 "Argentina is a mostly agrarian economy, owing to its mild climate, fertile soil and abundant water. The vast land it holds has seen considerable amounts of ranches and farms, with Argentina being one of the world's largest exporters of cattle meat, wool, corn, fruit wine, and wheat. As such, industry has lagged behind, with factories like those that dot Europe and North America only really being found in the capital and other major cities, and it will take the nation lot of time and effort to shift from its mostly-rural state to a more urban one."

  PB_ARG_Beacon_of_Liberty:0 "Southernmost Stronghold of Liberty"
  PB_ARG_Beacon_of_Liberty_desc:0 "Unlike most of Latin America, which are filled with despots like those in Gran Colombia and Mexico and oligarchical republics like those that dot the land of Brazil, Argentina is a true democracy,  Complete with a constitution that guarantees the rights and freedoms of civilians, a figurehead monarch, a bicameral congress, and proper division of power, Argentina is often seen as a bastion of liberty at the bottom of the world. Argentinians are immensely proud of their nation and its democracy, and will fight fiercely to keep their nation free from the shackles of tyranny that hold a good portion of the world in chains."
