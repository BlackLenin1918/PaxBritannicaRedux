  RUS_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YRussia§! is the undisputed hegemony in Eurasia in 1933.\n\nRussia has by far seen better days. Though a victor of the Great War this has ultimately amounted into minor gains in the form of territorial expansions. Unlike the then once believed idea that the war was some how going to fix the Russian bear's issues, this was false and folly.\n\nThe incompetent Tsar as a result had retreated into a life of solitude, blaming all his failures on his once considered allies. Though there is still hope for the Russian people, With the Tsar now slowly dying a painiful death the political sphere has begun to shift, everyday a figure of great importance to the Tsar goes missing, a position in government is changed, and one less loyal individual gains power. All know what the outcome will be for the Tsar in the coming days, alive or not.\n\nTime will tell if Russia will once again ascend into glory or fall and crumble like many have before her.\n\nRussia is a §YMajor Power§!."

  PB_RUS_Two_Alexanders:0 "A Tale of Two Alexanders"
  PB_RUS_Two_Alexanders_desc:0 "Russian history is a constant tug of war between reform and reaction, and this is most acutely felt with the last two Tsars of the Empire. Alexander II is, at least in contemporary times, viewed as a Second Peter the Great. His son, on the other hand, is viewed far less favorably.\n\nAlexander II's reforms, spurred on by his failed assassination, laid the groundwork for Russia's ascendance to global superpower status. His patronage of Nikola Tesla lead to Russia developing an overnight high technology industrial sector, and transformed the Imperial Military into a modern fighting force able to project Russian power anywhere in Eurasia.\n\nAlexander III, while he attempted to continue his father's reforms, found himself caught in the whirlwind of the Great War. The Butchered Victory was ultimately laid at his feet, and the National Rebellions of the 1920s destroyed his credibility. The exact sequence of events in the court that lead to his abdication are not, and may never be, known, but they culminating in his son Michael ascending the throne as Tsar Michael II.\n\nMichael has been pragmatic enough to continue the reforms of his forebears, perhaps hoping that standing on the shoulders of giants will once again lead Russia to greatness."
  PB_RUS_Russian_Twilight:0 "Butchered Victory"
  PB_RUS_Russian_Twilight_desc:0 "The Russian Empire was a critical frontline in the Great War, fighting across Siberia, Korea, Manchuria and Sakhalin. Combat in the Siberian campaign was brutal, and statistics indicate that most soldiers survived barely a few hours into deployment. Japanese forces made the Empire pay for every last inch, with a fanatical resistance and ingenuity that often invalidated Russia's technological advantage. Victory only came with the Third Battle of Busan, an eight month siege that left 80,000 Russian soldiers dead.\n\nIt should come as no surprise, then, that the terms of the Treaty of Tours were a shock to the Russian people. Russia kept almost none of her wartime gains, save Sakhalin and a few minor gains across Asia. Russia earned no colonies, Korea remained de-facto independent, and the unofficial occupation of Manchuria was to end immediately.\n\nIn a single penstroke, Britain and Germany drove a knife into the back of their Russian allies, and have spent the last twenty years rubbing salt in the open wound."
  PB_RUS_Hope_For_Future:0 "The Caesarean Section of Democracy"
  PB_RUS_Hope_For_Future_desc:0 "Democracy is often a time honored institution, treasured by the people and fought for with reckless abandon.\n\nHow then, does one bring democracy to an autocracy?\n\nThe answer, of course, depends on who you ask. In Russia, the democratic experiment has been an exercise in tension. Political parties have formed, split, and disbanded in the time it takes to finish lunch. Anarchists and nationalists engage in fistfights in the streets. Anywhere you look, you can strike sparks with the right look or the right words.\n\nFor many nations, the birth of democracy is a slow, delicate process.\n\nFor Russia, thus far it has been a bloody and violent and in many cases humiliating. In the end, though, it will be worth the pain.\n\n§RAssuming that the democratic experiment succeeds, of course.§!"
  PB_RUS_Middle_Class_Rising:0 "Rise of the Russian Middle Class"
  PB_RUS_Middle_Class_Rising_desc:0 "One of the biggest demograghic shifts of the Second Renaissance was the birth of the Russian middle class. For most of its' history, Russia was a country of haves and have-nots, with very little in between. As the industrial sector developed, however, the power of the nobility and the landowners was increasingly undermined by a growing caste of moderately wealthy former peasants.\n\nThese people would form the foundation of a middle class that would grow and mature to rival Russia's historic interest groups, and form the foundations for the rise of democracy. With industry came stable jobs, and with stable jobs came stable homes, and from that came the need for education, literacy, higher education, and intellectualism.\n\nThe middle class now forms the backbone of Russia's burgeoning political scene, and they will tenaciously defend their gains if need be."

  Russian_Assassination_Attempt.1.d:0 "It was hard to hear a portable radio over the sound of the crowd; an instrumental jazz tune hummed in one ear. She paid close attention to the notes, the warbling of the bass section, the trumpets blaring. As it all slowed to a close, an announcer with a thick Polish accent chimed in. It wasn’t the typical announcer, who at the moment was tied up in a broom closet.\n\n“Good morning, listeners. The time is eight AM. For those attending the parade this morning, the weather service has advised carrying a parasol due to the chance of rain. Don’t touch that dial now listeners, we’re just getting started with today’s catalogue-“\n\nKasandra flicked the radio off and dug her hands into her coat pockets, one hand withdrawing an old half burnt photograph. Two dirty looking children and their mother on a farm, smiling in squalor, faces distorted by melted film. The mother’s face was all but obscured by the charring; Kasandra couldn’t remember what she looked like.\n\nIn a few moments she was near the head of the crowd. The Tsar was off the podium, all smiles and shaking hands. A few nervous looking security agents orbited around him and shooed off the odd heckler. She made her way through the throng of people slowly, casually, pretending to try and get a better look. After a moment, she was within ten feet, the perfect distance.\n\nAs the Tsar made his way past, she casually slipped her hand into her pocket once more and withdrew a pistol. Seconds felt like hours now, adrenaline saturating as the sights leveled. One of the officers spotted her, sprinting towards the Tsar. Michael only had the briefest moment to glance at the commotion, eyes meeting the barrel of a gun. It was as if time stopped at that exact instant; an emperor faced with a peasant’s pistol. There wasn’t time to duck, all Michael could do was watch dumbfounded.\n\nOne barely audible prayer escaped the woman’s lips before she pulled the trigger.\n\n"God, please.""

They were all part of the committee that drafted the ambitious proposal and plans for the Trans-American Pipeline, aiming to tap into the oil-hungry markets of the slowly developing American West. Every conceivable aspect had been discussed, from projected profits to budget allocations and the choice of materials. Now, all they needed was the Tsar’s approval for such a massive undertaking.\n\nThe lilliputian bureaucrat who headed the committee, a man whose name the Tsar had long forgotten, seemed to drone on like an automaton for eternity on the trivial details of the pipeline. It was likely an attempt to assassinate the Tsar by sheer boredom.\n\n"Costs are estimated to run into the tens of millions," the bureaucrat continued, "but Tesla Electrickworks executives have offered to fund portions of the project if it opens the markets of the Wild West to them. However, large projects like this are also prone to cost overruns and corruption, which would push the costs even higher. The various factions in the Duma have also reacted diversely to the project, expressing everything from undying encouragement to the strongest opposition. The nationalists in the Duma have voiced..."\n\nThe Tsar’s eyelids grew heavy as the pull of sleep became almost irresistible. The bureaucrat was completely unaware and continued with his presentation. As he approached the end of his lecture, the Tsar returned to attention when the deadline was announced.\n\n"The estimated time of completion is around eight to ten years."\n\nThe Tsar scoffed in disbelief and waited for the punchline. He quickly realized that the official was serious about the timeline. He could hardly believe his ears; his country was among the very vanguard of technological progress, the home of the Second Renaissance. The notion of waiting a decade to penetrate the Western markets was preposterous. He was the Tsar, after all; he didn’t bend his will to the world—the world bent its will to him. He looked at the bureaucrat and uttered a single sentence."

  Russia_Rasputin.3.d:0 "The buzzards floated like honey bees as they escorted his unit to their destination. The Staff Sergeant could finally understand why the pilots called them buzzards; the engines would have blended in with the sounds of springtime. He looked down as his feet dangled over the edge, the rolling hills and forests of the Far East seemed endless, a true Russian beauty; it’s no wonder that crazed religious bastard chose to hide here, he thought. He gazed out towards the target on the horizon, a safehouse of the Rasputinite cult that infested Siberia like the native silk moths.\n\nThe touchdown went exactly as they had trained. As his feet hit the ground, his earpiece crackled to life, giving the Tsar and highest members of government a direct link to the men on the ground. The sprawling complex lay before them with multiple routes to the uppermost suite where intelligence believed Rasputin was. The Staff Sergeant gave his orders; jet troopers flew to the upper levels of the compound, hard suits charged through walls with concrete crumpling like paper, and razormaidens gleefully massacred every cultist they saw, eviscerating and dissecting indiscriminately. The Staff Sergeant, for his part, took the most direct way to Rasputin’s suspected room, the stairs to Rasputin’s personal suite.\n\nAfter exploring countless empty rooms and climbing even more stairs, the Staff Sergeant finally found the man who had terrorized the Siberian wastes lying in his bed with his arms around two women on each side. The man of god hardly looked like the embodiment of Christ that the cult desperately tried to project and advertise. He had the stock of a Siberian peasant with filthy, unshaven facial hair that would have been scorned in St. Petersburg. His face was gaunt and showed the stress and strains of being hunted by Earth’s mightiest empire and her feared intelligence service, the Okhrana. It seemed like the game of cat and mouse had aged him by decades as premature wrinkles racked the holy man’s face. The face reminded him of his grandfather. The connection and familial face weren't enough to save Rasputin, however. The Staff Sergeant hardly hesitated as he crucified Rasputin with a cross of bullets across his chest. He ignored the screams of the women and radioed back to headquarters."

  PB_RUS_Debate_on_Voting:0 "Debates on Voting Reform"
  PB_RUS_Debate_on_Voting_desc:0 "It has been clear for many years that the Duma is in an archaic state in its current form. The Tsar still holds an influential position in government thanks to the royal veto, with critics labelling the Duma as simply a ‘House of suggestion’. As such, it is imperative that we restrain the monarch’s powers and reform the system into a much more democratic constitutional monarchy by empowering the Duma.\n\nThis naturally includes revising our administrative structure, with many proposals already having been submitted. The two most popular options presented are that of a regionalist or centralised Duma. The former, favoured by the liberal voices in government, aims to enfranchise minorities by granting more autonomy and power to regional representatives. The latter, supported by the more conservative minds, calls for a centralised top-down approach with power consolidated within Moscow and therefore the ethnic Russian majority. The Duma shall be left to debate on which policy of reform to follow, let us see what Russia’s future holds."

This will allow power to be more efficiently handled from the capital and will give more power to the Russian Majority in the country. Our more liberal detractors argue that this is intended to reduce the power of ethnic minorities within Russia.

With a system of implants and monitors, we could use the network to regularly scan citizen's thought patterns for anti-state beliefs, which could then be corrected with a broadcasted counter-pattern. A minimally invasive model would allow us to, with relatively little effort, rapidly condition the population to be more passive and supportive of the regime, eventually §Rwithout them even realizing it.§!"

  PB_RUS_Okhrana_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe so-called §YFirst National Awakening§! ended in the defeat of the nationalist forces, yet for many the wars of independence never ended. Across the Ukraine, Poland, the Baltics, and Finland nationalist forces continue to struggle against Russian rule. Combating this is the §YDepartment for Protecting the Public Security and Order§!, colloquially known as the §YOkhrana§! or Guard Department. Previously just the state security apparatus of the Empire, the Okhrana was expanded dramatically following the Nationalist Rebellions to combat the remnant rebel forces.\n\nThe Okhrana is reliant on resources provided §Ymonthly§!; these resources must be used carefully to target and eliminate key figures in the secessionist movements to reduce their power. Additional §Ymonthly resources§! can be acquired by expanding Okhrana operations centers; however, these will require a large initial investment before becoming operational.\n\nOur goal is the §rdecapitation§! of rebel leadership, however eliminating leaders of rebel factions may drive them in different ideological directions and lead to other figures assuming command of the movement. A rebel group is §Yonly§! fully defeated once §Yall§! the most noteworthy members of their leadership are liquidated.\n\nIf the Okhrana fails to control the power of a rebel group, there may be §rdrastic§! consequences if they perceive us to be weak or distracted.\n\nCurrently, the Okhrana has access to £RUS_Okhrana_Resources §G[?RUS.RUS_Okhrana_Resources]§!

That promise cannot be utilized in our current Siberia, as the vastness of the land is simultaneously a boon and a curse. Siberia's infrastructure is lacking, the population consists of illiterate peasants and its villages house little to no economic activity or potential. Radical transformation is necessary. \n\nThe §YSiberian Plan§! charts the problems and issues of the area with the intention of bringing economic civilization to this wasteland in the near future. Across the European part of the Russian Empire, engineers, chemists, architects, officers and bureaucrats are shipped to work in the Siberian wilds. They all share the common goal of turning the infertile fertile, the impoverished wealthy and the uninteresting fascinating."

This golden boon is, however, guarded by meters of snow, protected by the intensely harsh climate of Northern Siberia. The proposal has thus been to give form to an entity with the goal of harvesting the gold deposits of the Far North in the form of the Far North Construction Company, headed by famed geologist Yuri Bilibin and under the management of the secret police and the interior ministry. \n\nThe mandate of the FNCC is clear: the extraction of valueable minerals from Northern Siberia. Under this mandate, the FNCC has the clearance to construct and operate the logistics and transport of the area, monitor its infrastructure and secure valueable labour pools from the Katorga colonies.

This caused the Russian government to begin to invest in the region, albeit half-heartedly as a result of the vast distance between the heartland of Russia and their colony. Such a distance convinced the government in Saint Petersburg to leave Alaska to control itself while Russia focused elsewhere, and in 1880, the "Russian America Reorganization Act" was enacted, reorganizing Alaska into the "United Colonies of Russian America", officializing its autonomy within the Russian Empire.\n\nThis has been the status quo until recently, when in 1927, the Vilkitsky Oil Basin, one of the largest such basins in North America, was discovered in the North Slope. The Alaskan economy skyrocketed as local companies and megacorporations began scrambling northwards in order to set up infrastructure to access the oil. However, the amount of oil that has been extracted from the basin has not been meaningful enough to allow the state of affairs to continue. As such, the Russian government has finally decided to place its stake in the Alaskan oil industry and has authorized the construction of a great singular pipeline, the Trans-American Pipeline, in order to begin effectively extracting the oil out of the remote basin and to the coast for usage within Russia proper.\n\nConditions are incredibly difficult due to Alaska's general nature, but that will not stop us from finishing our work and finally being able to completely tap into the great and vast wealth within Alaska's core and exploit its potential to the fullest.\n\nProgress of the §YTrans-American Pipeline§! - [?RUS.PB_RUS_Trans_Alaskan_Pipeline_var|%G]"
