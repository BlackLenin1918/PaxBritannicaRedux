Though a victor of the Great War this has ultimately amounted into minor gains in the form of territorial expansions. Unlike the then once believed idea that the war was some how going to fix the Russian bear's issues, this was false and folly.\n\nThe incompetent Tsar as a result had retreated into a life of solitude, blaming all his failures on his once considered allies. Though there is still hope for the Russian people, With the Tsar now slowly dying a painiful death the political sphere has begun to shift, everyday a figure of great importance to the Tsar goes missing, a position in government is changed, and one less loyal individual gains power. All know what the outcome will be for the Tsar in the coming days, alive or not.\n\nTime will tell if Russia will once again ascend into glory or fall and crumble like many have before her.\n\nRussia is a §YMajor Power§!."

Nicholas spends his days resting Vacant and Broken on the Imperial Throne letting his court and country decay apart from his seething hatred for his former allies who he blames for all his tragedies. Like an uncaring father he remains complaciant for those that openly harass the very people he was sworn to protect. His recent acquisition of Typhus has only worsened this terrible habit of political negligence and many have questioned his effectiveness as a Tsar although seemingly the waiting list for heir of the Russian Empire shortens almost daily. If his health continues to worsen as is the case currently then Russia's early start to the 20th century will be one ruled by multiple hands, that all share the same blood, potentially.\n\nAlexei is the official successor to the throne although many have raised their voice in protest for such a fact. Alternatively there is Alexandra, his wife, who is far more popular with her liberalist views which have unsurprisingly caused much provocation between the Tsar and her. There is also Kirill, the first cousin of Nicholas II; a renowned aristocrat with many political connections makes Kirill the most likely out of the three main candidates to ascend to power. Whatever the case may be for the Empire one thing for sure is that whoever succeeds the ailing tyrant will define Russia for the rest of the century.\n\n§RLike a phoenix arison from hell Russia, and all those responsible for its pain will suffer in the most unholiest of ways.§!"

  PB_RUS_aftermath_of_the_nationalist_revolts_desc:0 "The Nationalist Revolts of the 1920s have forever damned Russia; any dreams of a united slavic peoples has gone down the drain, for now. While the Prussians, Poles, Finnish, Balts and Caucasians all enjoy nominal "independence" there is a clear motive by the Russian state to fully reintegrate theses divided territories. While the Germans may have demanded that autonomy be granted to these newly birthed lands such demands were enforced in a time where Russia was weak, that is no longer the case. While Frankfurt and London may cry independence there is little they can truly do now. Russia will be united, whether they like it or not.\n\nThose of Jewish origin arguably suffer the worst out of all of Russia's various ethnicities. Worker camps have been set up around Russia where thousands of Jews have been 'employed' in life threatening laborious activities. Many often die in the first few days, even those that have managed to outlive the rest of their brothers and sisters typically meet a death far worse than starvation or over exhaustion. Despite the quantity and organized nature of these camps only Moscow knows of their existance, and if any information about the labour camps was to somehow leave the confines of Russia, then Moscow may have an international emergency on their hands."

Rather we have come to see the Polish as victims of Russia's unhuman brutality and aggression and have welcomed Polish Exiles and Refugees so that they could spread their stories and rebuild their resistance.\n\nIn the last years the Empire has tried to fully reintragrate their Polish Administration and russianize the Polish Population. But the Polish are now fighting back again. The Revolt is larger then any other before and could truly suceed in regaining indepedence.\n\nThe Russians are on a timelimit if they do not crush the Revolt in 3 Months, political and global pressure will force them out of Poland. Some people in the government are pushing to send great amounts of supplies to the Polish in hopes to gain a new ally against the Russia. However not everyone is fully convinced of the chances of Polish Sucees and might see support as ineffective and pointless in the end."

If he had shown even a shred of passion in his political workings as he did for his survival then maybe Russia could truly be all that he had imagined; but these were the end times of his story, and the final pages were rapidly approaching. When the cohort of medical specialists had finally arrived, his eyes stalked their every movement. Their frantic activity and heightened conversations solidified the fact that any news that was to be made would be rather unpromising at best, devastating at worst. Finally, the doctors and nurses came to a standstill, eyeing each other down until one soul was brave enough to break the awkward silence that filled the room. After a brief stare down between doctors and nurses the youngest practitioner of the group was unilaterally ‘voted’ to present the cohort’s findings.\n\n“It’s not good news.” Garbled the nervous boy.\n\n“We suspect that in the following days the situation regarding your health will deteriorate.”\n\nAlexandra who sat just beside the Tsar indicated with her right hand for the folder to be brought to her. Hurryingly a nurse shifted through the medical staff and handed the report over. The tsarina’s eyes scanned up and down page by page in search of specific findings, occasionally she would shift her focus to the Tsar and back to the folder. When the final page had been reached, she closed the report and delicately kissed Nicholas’ forehead. "
