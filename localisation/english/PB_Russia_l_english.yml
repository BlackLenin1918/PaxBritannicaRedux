  RUS_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YRussia§! is the undisputed hegemony in Eurasia in 1933.\n\nRussia has by far seen better days. Though a victor of the Great War this has ultimately amounted into minor gains in the form of territorial expansions. Unlike the then once believed idea that the war was some how going to fix the Russian bear's issues, this was false and folly.\n\nThe incompetent Tsar as a result had retreated into a life of solitude, blaming all his failures on his once considered allies. Though there is still hope for the Russian people, With the Tsar now slowly dying a painiful death the political sphere has begun to shift, everyday a figure of great importance to the Tsar goes missing, a position in government is changed, and one less loyal individual gains power. All know what the outcome will be for the Tsar in the coming days, alive or not.\n\nTime will tell if Russia will once again ascend into glory or fall and crumble like many have before her.\n\nRussia is a §YMajor Power§!."

  PB_RUS_Two_Alexanders:0 "A Tale of Two Alexanders"
  PB_RUS_Two_Alexanders_desc:0 "Russian history is a constant tug of war between reform and reaction, and this is most acutely felt with the last two Tsars of the Empire. Alexander II is, at least in contemporary times, viewed as a Second Peter the Great. His son, on the other hand, is viewed far less favorably.\n\nAlexander II's reforms, spurred on by his failed assassination, laid the groundwork for Russia's ascendance to global superpower status. His patronage of Nikola Tesla lead to Russia developing an overnight high technology industrial sector, and transformed the Imperial Military into a modern fighting force able to project Russian power anywhere in Eurasia.\n\nAlexander III, while he attempted to continue his father's reforms, found himself caught in the whirlwind of the Great War. The Butchered Victory was ultimately laid at his feet, and the National Rebellions of the 1920s destroyed his credibility. The exact sequence of events in the court that lead to his abdication are not, and may never be, known, but they culminating in his son Michael ascending the throne as Tsar Michael II.\n\nMichael has been pragmatic enough to continue the reforms of his forebears, perhaps hoping that standing on the shoulders of giants will once again lead Russia to greatness."
  PB_RUS_Russian_Twilight:0 "Butchered Victory"
  PB_RUS_Russian_Twilight_desc:0 "The Russian Empire was a critical frontline in the Great War, fighting across Siberia, Korea, Manchuria and Sakhalin. Combat in the Siberian campaign was brutal, and statistics indicate that most soldiers survived barely a few hours into deployment. Japanese forces made the Empire pay for every last inch, with a fanatical resistance and ingenuity that often invalidated Russia's technological advantage. Victory only came with the Third Battle of Busan, an eight month siege that left 80,000 Russian soldiers dead.\n\nIt should come as no surprise, then, that the terms of the Treaty of Tours were a shock to the Russian people. Russia kept almost none of her wartime gains, save Sakhalin and a few minor gains across Asia. Russia earned no colonies, Korea remained de-facto independent, and the unofficial occupation of Manchuria was to end immediately.\n\nIn a single penstroke, Britain and Germany drove a knife into the back of their Russian allies, and have spent the last twenty years rubbing salt in the open wound."
  PB_RUS_Hope_For_Future:0 "The Caesarean Section of Democracy"
  PB_RUS_Hope_For_Future_desc:0 "Democracy is often a time honored institution, treasured by the people and fought for with reckless abandon.\n\nHow then, does one bring democracy to an autocracy?\n\nThe answer, of course, depends on who you ask. In Russia, the democratic experiment has been an exercise in tension. Political parties have formed, split, and disbanded in the time it takes to finish lunch. Anarchists and nationalists engage in fistfights in the streets. Anywhere you look, you can strike sparks with the right look or the right words.\n\nFor many nations, the birth of democracy is a slow, delicate process.\n\nFor Russia, thus far it has been a bloody and violent and in many cases humiliating. In the end, though, it will be worth the pain.\n\n§RAssuming that the democratic experiment succeeds, of course.§!"
  PB_RUS_Middle_Class_Rising:0 "Rise of the Russian Middle Class"
  PB_RUS_Middle_Class_Rising_desc:0 "One of the biggest demograghic shifts of the Second Renaissance was the birth of the Russian middle class. For most of its' history, Russia was a country of haves and have-nots, with very little in between. As the industrial sector developed, however, the power of the nobility and the landowners was increasingly undermined by a growing caste of moderately wealthy former peasants.\n\nThese people would form the foundation of a middle class that would grow and mature to rival Russia's historic interest groups, and form the foundations for the rise of democracy. With industry came stable jobs, and with stable jobs came stable homes, and from that came the need for education, literacy, higher education, and intellectualism.\n\nThe middle class now forms the backbone of Russia's burgeoning political scene, and they will tenaciously defend their gains if need be."
