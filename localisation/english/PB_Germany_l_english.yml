  # IDEAS
  ##########################
  PB_GER_Economic_Depression:0 "The Long Depression"
  PB_GER_Economic_Depression_desc:0 "The interwar years have not been kind to the German Empire. The failed colonialist policies and foreign policy blunders of the Ludendorf government, combined with the immediate economic crash after the end of hostilities in 1910, contributed a general depression across the entire continent. This lead to political instability throughout the Empire, driving away foreign investment and forcing Germany to lean on their internal industries and colonies to survive. This has lead to a Germany dramatically weakened and produced an unheard of 13% unemployment rate, with poverty running rampant."
  PB_GER_Political_Gridlock:0 "Bundestag Gridlock"
  PB_GER_Political_Gridlock_desc:0 "The ongoing economic crisis has fermented gridlock throughout the Empire's primary legislative body, the Bundestag. The divides between the leftist labour movements and the conservative right have deepened dramatically, preventing meaningful legislative solutions to Germany's myriad of political problems."
  PB_GER_Prussian_Separatism:0 "Prussian Separatism"
  PB_GER_Prussian_Separatism_desc:0 "Since the defeat of the Prussian Kingdom during the Wars of Austrian Consolidation, the Easternmost territories of the Empire remain the most rebellious. Eastern Germany and Prussia remain a hotbed of ultranationalist sentiments, with the Prussian Freikorps, or Free Corps, a constant problem with the local authorities. These hyper-reactionary militias frequently come into conflict with both the police and leftist political leaders, leading Eastern Germany to gain a reputation for being unstable and dangerous."
  PB_GER_Great_War_Victor:0 "Enough Dead Heroes for the End of Time"
  PB_GER_Great_War_Victor_desc:0 "Germany stood among the victors of the Great War, further cementing the nation as one of the preeminent world powers and finally breaking the perfidious Bourbons. Yet, more than a decade later many are still war weary. Germany suffered tremendous losses throughout the war, with millions laying down their lives in the trenches of Flanders and Alsace to achieve victory. Germany took their place in the sun, but for many, there are enough dead heroes buried in Flanders' fields for the end of time."

With the liberalizing reforms of Kaiser Rudolf, starkly contrasted with the conservatism of his father, Germany has become a beacon of social, scientific and cultural progress in a Europe which is increasingly hostile to those ideas. The mass exodus of refugees from Russia and France has created a vibrant, unflinchingly internationalist cultural landscape."

With the economy in shambles, ill-intentioned radicals are stirring up trouble throughout the fatherland. Jacobin revolutionaries speak to packed coffee houses, spouting the doctrine of revolution and socialist utopia. Hardline nationalists pour into the beer halls of Bavaria and Berlin, eager to denounce everything from the Jacobins to the Jews. Outbreaks of political violence are not uncommon and thus far the administration has been unwilling to crack down on them openly for fear of exacerbating the issue."

  ##########################
  germany.1.t:0 "The Kaiser's New Years Address"
  germany.1.d:0 "As the new year begins, celebrations throughout Germany have begun to peeter out. Early in the morning, Kaiser Rudolf II appeared before a gathered crowd in Frankfurt to deliver his new years address. His speech contained little in terms of tangible promises to the people, keeping in line with his generally apolitical stance, but of particular note was his consistent references to the need for \" more modern leadership for the Empire.\"\n\nThese cues, coupled with the Kaiser's general withdrawal from public life, has lead to concerns among the nobility of weakness. Though the Kaiser has rebuffed any concerns from his advisors to the contrary, it has become something of an open secret that the Kaiser has sought retirement from his position for some time. The Kaiser's retreat from publicity has lead to greater indirect power being vested in the hands of the Autonomous Kingdoms, with King Rupprecht of Bavaria supposedly mocking the Kaiser as \"feminine and weak\" for focusing more on his family life.\n\nRegardless, the government does not run on rumors, and Chancellor Stresemann believes that he can finally push his reform plan through the Bundestag this year."
  germany.1.a:0 "Perhaps 1933 will finally be our year..."

  germany.2.t:0 "Bread Riots in the Rhineland"
  germany.2.d:0 "Political violence is not unheard of in Germany, and almost a decade of economic downturn has lead to many instances of rioting. In Koblenz, however, a series of bread riots rapidly got out of control, leading to nearly twenty five deaths and dozens of injured.\n\nRelief efforts in the Rhineland have been ongoing for the last year due to crop failures, and the region continues to suffer from one of the nation's higher poverty rates. According to witnesses, bread being distributed in a poorer neighborhood of Koblenz escalated into violence when bread supplies began to run out. After being denied their ration, reportedly several men assaulted the relief workers before being shot by the police. In the ensuing chaos, four police officers were tackled and beaten while relief offices were ransacked.\n\nMinister-President Goebbels has sent a furious letter to the offices of Frankfurt, demanding the deployment of the Nationalgarde to Koblenz."
  germany.2.a:0 "Goebbels is a hysteric. Absolutely not..."
  germany.2.b:0 "I suppose we could spare some reservists..."

  germany.3.t:0 "The Kaiser calls on Stresemann"
  germany.3.d:0 "Stresemann met with the Kaiser earlier this morning over lunch, and returned to his office visibly shaken. When questioned, he stated that the Kaiser confided in him that he planned to abdicate the throne. According to the Chancellor, the Kaiser was open that the stress of rule and his advancing age had begun to severely affect his health.\n\nHis statements are not without merit, Stresemann stated, as the Kaiser had been hospitalized in 1930 following a bout of pneumonia. Though the incident was largely kept out of the papers, the event had \"made his majesty acutely aware of his mortality.\"\n\nThough there are no legitimate concerns regarding succession, Stresemann believes that the abdication is \"exactly the kind of chaotic mess we can't afford right now.\""
  germany.3.a:0 "...Oh."

  germany.4.t:0 "Kaiser Rudolf Abdicates the Throne"
  germany.4.d:0 "When the news reached the people, most did not know to respond.\nConfused? Sad? "Fearful of the Future?\n\nWhen was the last time a Kaiser Abdicated? Did it ever happen? Now people were remembering one important detail surrounding all of this. The Kaiser had only one heir, his daughter Elisabeth Marie.\n\nA woman. After 250 Years a woman would again come to bear the title of Kaiser. However everyone knew she would not become the next Maria Theresa. While personal friends often give her the nickname of 'Erzsi', the public and especially her greatest doubters call her the'Red Princess'. Elizabeth has made some years ago pubibly that she believes in the values of socialism, peace and unity. Despite being forbidden to join a party, she has several contacts and friends in the labour party and she herself organized food banks for poor people during this depression.\n\nDespite protests of several politicians, Rudolf insisted that she would suceed him as Kaiserin. And so when all Germans were able to see the coronation of their new Kaiserin on television, it is not unfounded to say that they had the same thoughts in those moments.\n\n What will happen now?"

  germany.7.t:0 "The Hirschfeld Institute"
  germany.7.d:0 "The political and social upheaval of the interwar years produced a vibrant community of theorists in Germany. Of particular note was Magnus Hirschfeld, a leading figure in sexual studies. Born in Kolberg, Brandenburg-Prussia, Hirschfeld spent the interwar years pioneering his research of alternative sexuality.\n\nHirschfeld’s most notable work in recent years has been his advocacy for the concept of “spectrum sexuality.” Spectrum Sexuality argues for the idea of gender and sexual preference as a fluid concept and independent of one-another, going against the traditional sexology studies on the subject. In addition to this, Hirschfeld has been a prominent advocate of homosexual rights throughout Germany, often butting heads with more conservatively minded politicians. Up until recently, the Hirschfeld Institute of Sexual Studies has been funded by private investors, however now Hirschfeld himself has approached the German government to seek official support."

  germany.19.t:0 "A Murder in Vienna"
  germany.19.d:0 "Shots rang out in the city center of Vienna this afternoon as an unidentified, strangely dressed man suddenly fired on another at a cafe. Before the stranger could escape, he was apprehended by the local police and taken in for questioning. The man he targeted, 44 year old local Adolf Hitler, died from his wounds shortly after the attack. Hitler, a local painter in the Vienna Artist Commune, served a brief term of service in the Reichsheer before being forced to retire due to wounds suffered from a French gas attack\n\nThe unidentified stranger, who spoke with an abnormal German dialect, explained frantically about \"going to the wrong timeline\" and showed investigators a series of photos of what appeared to be people behind barbed wire and some kind of large mushroom-shaped explosion. When it was explained that he would be indicted for murder, the man claimed he \"shouldn't have rounded up his calculations\" before gunning down the two interviewing officers with a hidden automatic pistol and escaping the police station. Police were unable to find where the man had escaped to, but did find that he had left a leather jacket with a few personal affects.\n\nAmong the stranger's possessions was a small black device with a plastic exterior and a button that would open it to reveal a key. Several buttons on the top would cause a small red light to flash as well. The items were handed off to Evidenzburo officials the following day, who plan to continue investigating the bizarre murder."

These same notable stances are also what lead to the party being banned by the German government.\n\nDriven underground, the ALNU has become more akin to a terrorist organization.

  germany.48.d:0 "The Region of Czechia has been become a region of rising unrest in the last decades. With rising nationalism in Europe it seems like the Czech People are more and more seeing themself as a seperate culture groups then us Germans. Despite being a part of the Holy Roman Empire for more then 600 Years the Czechs never truly became Germans and are now seeming to beginn a path of seperatism. Czech Language is spoken more in school, German Adminstrators are being replaced by young competent Czechs and so on. The biggest problem is however the Czech Legion.\n\nThe Czech Legion is the equivalent of the Freikorps Groups in other German Cities with the key difference that they are fighting against German Influence in Czechia. Harassment of German Citiziens, organizing strikes against German-Factories and even terrorism. However they are not a terrorism group truthfully and were able to inspire Czech Nationalism in their region due the neglience of the old Government.\n\nDespit Army Commanders and a majority of politicians advocating of an violent purge of this group, the Thalmann wants to avoid spilling more blood in Germany and fears it could lead to more radical terrorism. The Government has arranged a meeting with the most prominent leaders of the Czech Legion, led by Josef Šnejdárek. He seems to be aware that a rebellion against Germany will likely not be sucessful and rather demands more autonomy for the Czech inside the United Kingdoms. However the demands he has are hard to accept as they severly restrict German Centralization over the Region and reduce German Buisnesses."

However it seems that information about the raid leaked and the Czechs had fortified their headquaters, ready to fight for their independence.\n\n After 3 Hours of exhausting city fighting the troops had to retreat. Casualties were high and the morale of the Czechs appeared to grow stronger. Seeing such heavy resistance, the government finally decided to show no more restraint in the matter. In the next hours special mortar teams, armored cars and even flamethrowers arrived on the scene. The Second Battle was over quickly with the complete destruction of the Czech Legions.\n\nWhile some elements of the Legion might have gone underground the leadership decided to fight until the bitter end. Josef Šnejdárek personally fought with his machine gun until he was burned alive by a Flammenwerfer Unit. Some politicians are already showing some kind of regret for this kind of bloody battle. Not out of sympathy but rather out of fear that we just elevated the dead of the Legion to martyrs of their cause."

While more political turmoil and elections are not the things the nation need right now, the Kaiserin thinks Germany needs a new government to change the rusty gears it has been running on for so long now.\n\nFranz Blücher will temporarily take over the Chancellory and Liebknecht, Müller and Külz have agreed to maintain their ministries positions until the next government has been voted into power."

She wanted to do what was best for the people of Germany, dreams of workers in the street celebrating better conditions and the shining beacon of Liberty in Europe standing up to all those who fought against them. But she had failed. The cries of the workers will go forever unheard, the very radical ideologies that threatened liberty on the continent have tainted the seats of government.\n\nShe sat in her large Imperial office, decorated in all manner afforded to a leader of such a major power. If a lowly peasant had seen this room, they’d think the gates of heaven had greeted them. She looked at the various beauties of this room, the gold in the pillars, pale white paint, luxurious seats and pillows to go with them. But she’d trade it away in a second to save Germany. But now it was over.\n\n“Your Majesty,” spoke one of the government officials who sat in front of her desk, “we are awaiting your signature.”\n\nElizabeth sighed as he looked out at the window, seeing the marching tides of Nationalism everywhere. Propaganda posters, armed guards patrolling the streets, it was worse than seeing the capital burn. With a heavy heart she at her desk, looking at the document that was pushed toward her. It was filled with bureaucratic nonsense to try and make those reading it sign it out of boredom. But she knew exactly what it was saying, for she was not a fool. In essence signing this document would result in one thing.\n\nAbdication.\n\n“If you sign now, we can guarantee that you will be allowed to live in internal exile at one of your summer homes. On the condition, you retire completely from all political action and comply with security-”\n\n“I know.” Elizabeth said coldly, silencing the government officials. She gripped the provided fountain pen and looked down at the bottom. The empty line where she had to sign her name. With a heavy heart, she signed, resigning to her fate."

Rathenau waited patiently for these voices of discontent to stay silent, his gaze searched through the Reichstag before falling upon Hungenberg for a brief moment. And then, the Chancellor began his response:\n\n“Honourable and noble members of this Diet, you have heard very...colourful terms used in response to one of our most recent pieces of legislation, talk of spies and conspiracy amongst the Jewish population of our nation, especially from the right honourable Hugenberg. But I come to you requesting a chance to speak and offer my perspective on our nation’s actions. And fortunately I have been granted an opportunity to do so.\n\nMany of those who do not approve of the actions of our government claim that Jews are traitors, thieves, with more than a few of them disputing their very humanity, along with their citizenship and the status of this land as their home. You call us traitors and cowards, but ignore our sacrifices during the war. Hundreds if not thousands of Jews volunteered, giving life and limb for Germany. You claim we have taken our money, while it is Jewish businesses contribute to our economy. And you say that Germany is not our land, that there is no greater honour than driving us out. But we have lived here for centuries, long before any of you were born. Even in the days of the Holy Roman Empire, my people were here, we have earned our place in Germany.\n\nYou claim that such beliefs and practices are noble, but where is the honour in driving away honest hard working people who sacrificed everything for a country that brates them! That does everything they can to fix our ailing economy, just as any other German would! All while you ignore the storm clouds forming over Europe, the Revanchism of France grows as it eyes to absorb our territory. If you truly cared for Germany, you would see the real threat rather than chasing make believe boogeymen who only exist in your imagination! Bring us together, instead of dividing us apart.”\n\nThe ministers and politicians cheered, waving the flags of Germany, celebrating this speech as a victory in itself. Over the tide of anti-semitism, as Rathenau looked out to the crowd, he could see the quiet fury of Hungenberg, he knew this would be an uphill battle. But this was a start."

Women knew their place, taking care of the children and cooking the meals for those hard-working men who provided for their families.\n\nNow, the old fool has allowed our society to be corrupted. Those fleeing France and Russia turn up at our nation’s doorstep, bringing with them Russia’s drunken toxins and France’s horrific taste in cinema. Women roam the streets, smoking and drinking while flaunting around their hair and bodies like prostitutes. With each passing day, it seemed like our once glorious nation was doomed towards decadence, corruption and anarchism.\n\nBut now, we have a fighting chance to save Germany. Action must be taken to ensure this corrupting ideology be swept aside to pave the way for a united and strong Germany, like was formed in the aftermath of the Franco-German War of 1870.

  PB_GER_Kingdom_Influence_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Kingdoms of Germany is a federation of German states, under which many former Austrian-aligned Kingdoms have maintained autonomy under their local rulers. Though once this decentralized system transformed Germany into a center of political thought and culture, now autonomy has become a crutch for the German state. The ongoing economic depression has reignted nationalism in many of the strongest German states, some of whom have begun to entertain ideas of going it alone again.\n\nIn order to pass meaningful reform and centralize the German government, unrest in the major kingdoms must be kept below §Y50%§! in order to pass §YCentralization Reforms§!. These reforms will prevent further unrest and, at least in that regard, stabilize one aspect of German politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

POLITICS_KARL_DONITZ_DESC:0 ""The North German does not go in for extremes. He has broader horizons than the men from the mountains of Bavaria and Austria."\n\n§YBorn:§!16/9/1891\n\nKarl Dönitz earned his glory, in the Great War he served in the German Navy like no other sailor could show. He is efficient, ruthless and seems to feel not a bit of pressure. At the end of the war he became of Germany's Greatest War Heroes. He continued to serve in the Navy gaining prestige and ranks through his persistance on continuous development of Naval Technology and Doctrines. With his rising tensions in the recent years in the Pacific the now Admiral Dönitz was dispatched as Statthalter to the Pacific Commonwealth. There he hopefully shall root out rising internal resistance and shield the colonies from foreign aggression.\n\nHowever if we look under the facade of Admiral Dönitz we might learn more about what a man he truly is."

Agreeing to [From.GetLeader]'s proposal would make [Root.GetNameDef] a moderately autonomous puppet of [From.GetNameDef] and our government will be reorganized into something more in line with [From.GetLeader]'s vision.\n\nThe question remains, is [Root.GetAdjective] independence more important than our friendship with [From.GetNameDef]?"

Accepting would make us a puppet of [From.GetNameDef].\n\nThough we would rather not surrender our independence to our enemies across the border, there's a definite element of threat in their message that would lead us to believe that if we do not meet [From.GetLeader]'s demands, we will soon find ourselves in a state of war with [From.GetNameDef]."
