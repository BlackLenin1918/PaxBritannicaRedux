  GER_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YFeatures:§!\n    - Unite Europa under one banner\n    - Manage the state of Federation\n    - Continue the fight in exile\n    - Maintain Germany's vast empire\n    - Become a continental European hegemon\n    - Set Germany on a path of economic greatness\n\n§YSituation:§!\nThe Empire of Germany is the preeminent continental power in Europe in 1933.\n\nEmerging from their defeat in the §YFirst Franco German War§!, the Holy Roman Empire found itself in a state of flux. Wracked by the liberal revolutions following the §YFrench Reformation§!, many within the Empire's Habsburg hegemon feared complete dissolution. Others, however, like Emperor Francis II, saw the defeat as an opportunity. The peoples of Germany had been defeated once, and they would never be defeated again.\n\nThis began the period known as the §YWars of Consolidation§!. Either through agreement or arms, Austria and her allies began the ardous process of centralizing and reforming the Empire. This period of conflict would come to a head with the §YAustro-Prussian War§!. Offering territorial concessions in Poland to Russia in exchange for their assistance, Austria invaded and strangled the nascent Prussian superpower in the crib. With the back of the Hohenzollerns broken, Austria turned her attentions East to Alsace-Lorraine. The §YSecond Franco German War§! saw the Germans avenge their defeat in 1797 and in a lavish ceremony in Versailles, Franz Joseph I was crowned as the first Kaiser of the German Empire.\n\nThis state of affairs proved too much for Austria's own constituencies in Hungary and Illyria, who demanded self-determination from the new German state. The §Y1870 Ausgleich Treaty§! saw Hungary gain independence in all but name, while Austria's southern Slavic provinces were reorganized into the §YDinaric Federation§! as a Dominion of Germany. This state of affairs proved unsustainable with the outbreak of the §YGreat War§!. As Germany fought brutal trench warfare across Flanders and Wallonia, their Hungarian allies collapsed into revolution while the Dinaric Federation broke free in the fervor of Slavic ultranationalism that gripped the Balkans.\n\nThough a victor in the war, Germany decisively lost the peace. The §YLong Depression§!, the postwar collapse of the European economies, fermented political unrest of all kinds. Germany's former Russian ally has gone sour and blames the German hegemon for their postwar decline. Even worse, the resurgent and revanchist French state is seemingly on a collision course for war once more. Only iron and blood will see Germany through these dark days.\n"

  PB_GER_Economic_Depression:0 "The Long Depression"
  PB_GER_Economic_Depression_desc:0 "The interwar years have not been kind to the German Empire. The failed colonialist policies and foreign policy blunders of the Ludendorf government, combined with the immediate economic crash after the end of hostilities in 1910, contributed a general depression across the entire continent. This lead to political instability throughout the Empire, driving away foreign investment and forcing Germany to lean on their internal industries and colonies to survive. This has lead to a Germany dramatically weakened and produced an unheard of 13% unemployment rate, with poverty running rampant."
  PB_GER_Political_Gridlock:0 "Bundestag Gridlock"
  PB_GER_Political_Gridlock_desc:0 "The ongoing economic crisis has fermented gridlock throughout the Empire's primary legislative body, the Bundestag. The divides between the leftist labour movements and the conservative right have deepened dramatically, preventing meaningful legislative solutions to Germany's myriad of political problems."
  PB_GER_Prussian_Separatism:0 "Prussian Separatism"
  PB_GER_Prussian_Separatism_desc:0 "Since the defeat of the Prussian Kingdom during the Wars of Austrian Consolidation, the Easternmost territories of the Empire remain the most rebellious. Eastern Germany and Prussia remain a hotbed of ultranationalist sentiments, with the Prussian Freikorps, or Free Corps, a constant problem with the local authorities. These hyper-reactionary militias frequently come into conflict with both the police and leftist political leaders, leading Eastern Germany to gain a reputation for being unstable and dangerous."

  PB_GER_Great_War_Victor_desc:0 "Germany stood among the victors of the Great War, further cementing the nation as one of the preeminent world powers and finally breaking the perfidious Bourbons. Yet, more than a decade later many are still war weary. Germany suffered tremendous losses throughout the war, with millions laying down their lives in the trenches of Flanders and Alsace to achieve victory. Germany took their place in the sun, but for many, there are enough dead heroes buried in Flanders' fields for the end of time."

In his old age, His Majesty feels that he can no longer properly execute the duties of the throne and the throne will soon pass to his only child, Princess Elisabeth. Though this alone would not be a great crisis for our country, the unstable nature of this all has caused Gustav Streseman and his cabinet to resign. Per the German constitution, fresh elections must be held soon to form a new government, even as the political situation has become increasingly polarized without Rudolf's guiding hand at the helm. It seems the months ahead will be a time of chaos."
  PB_GER_New_Elections:0 "Elections"
  PB_GER_New_Elections_desc:0 "With Streseman's government having resigned, the time has now come for the German people to elect a new government. Though more minor parties do exist, the next government will likely be formed by one of the three major parties in Germany. The socialist SB commands a great deal of support from the working class, and promises a program of extensive reform to increase workers rights, centralize the nation, and nationalize key industries. The Liberals in the UDP hope to provide a progressive future for Germany, prosposing economic liberalization, massive reforms to the ducation system, and new measures to improve our military and fight extremists. Finally, the arch-conservative DV promises to fight against degenerate modernism, create a world-class army and war economy, and strengthen the power of the government. The elections are predicted to be close, and whoever emerges victorious will certainly do so by the skin of their teeth. Only God knows what the future has in store for Germany."

Already, our plans for nationalizing major industries and expanding workers' rights have won over the suport of millions. Though the road ahead will be a difficult and dangerous one, it is the belief of every member of the SB, from the lowliest worker to allegedly the Kaiserin herself that Bismarck's legacy will be realized in full. Long Live Socialism! "

Gaining her support will be a valuable asset not only in increasing our control of the government but spreading our message to the German people as well.

Millions of Germans toil in the factories for hours upon end, facing hard work and hazardous conditions for so little pay they cannot afford to make ends meet. This state of affairs should offend any decent man. We will prepare a set of sweeping labor laws to protect the rights of workers to organize and strike, set a minimum wage, and provide state pensions for the sick, retired, and infirm. From now on, Germany will put people before profits, and the Capitalist Class will learn to accept this state of affairs if they want to keep their greedy pockets full."

The northern states were the home of the Protestant Reformation, while our ruling monarchy descends from Holy Roman emperors crowned by the Pope himself. Unfortunately, the Church and its institutions limit the glorious potential of the German people, holding back our plans for reform and social progress.

Bankrupt businesses shutter their doors. Though the Right will certainly decry the great cost of what must be done, we know that the German people need immediate relief before the economy gets any worse. A sum totalling over two billion Kroner will be spent on emergency handouts, bailing out failing banks and businesses, and increasing the size and scope of our budding welfare system. In addition, an extensive Public Works program will be created to provide work for the unemployed masses and improve the nation's infrastructure, power generation, and industries."

These Fat-Cat Capitalists do nothing but line their own pockets with the blood, sweat, and tears of millions of German workers while prices rise and wages fall, worsening the rampant inequality and economic woes seen nationwide. Pursuant to our agenda of creating a fair, equal, and socialist Germany, corporations operating in key industries will be nationalized and wages increased across the board. Notably, this plan will include the total nationalization of assets in areas such as rail, electric power, utilities, banking, armament industries, mining, and many other crucial elements of the German economy."
  PB_GER_Tragic_Rearmament:0 "Facing Reality"
  PB_GER_Tragic_Rearmament_desc:0 "Unfortunately, our desire for peace in Europe is threatened by enemies across the continent. The Revanchists in France plot and scheme to get revenge against our victory in the Great War and reverse the gains of our hard=won victories. Already, they have rearmed in contravention of post-war treaties and gathered allies to prepare for their intended destruction of Germany. Even worse, our old allies in Russia have seemingly turned against us -- angered by their minimal gains in the Great War for an enormous cost in life, they have allied with the Prussian extremists and are poised to invade us from the East.\n\n Sadly, our plans for peaceful development and pan-European cooperation must be put on hold. New economic developments will be focused on the rapid rearmament of the German army, increased mobilization, and the extension of conscription until the European crisis ends. If Europe were to plunge into total war once more, the German nation must be ready. We will be victorious, or we will certainly perish in the flames of revenge."
  PB_GER_German_Federation_Unify_States:0 "Equality among the German States"

Because of this, development has been largely focused in Austria and her periphery, while the northern regions of Germany have been left in the dust. Some SB leaders from Brandenburg and Lower Saxony have proposed a new amendment to the Constitution that will give all German states equal representation in the Reichsrat, hopefully allowing for the development of a stronger and more equal Germany."
  PB_GER_German_Federation_Centralization:0 "Continue Centralization"
  PB_GER_German_Federation_Centralization_desc:0 "Centralization is a dirty word in German politics. Having been a hot=button issue since the day we unified, Germans are deeply divided when it comes to how exactly to organize the federation. That being said, much to the chagrin of local rulers, the SB has always favored a program of centralizing the state and reducing the traditional powers of the German states. Though we certainly respect ethnic and cultural autonomy, as the German people are a diverse nation, we cannot allow for outdated administrative borders and petty princes to stand in the way of our plans for Germany. Increased centralization will lead to more administrative efficency, a less bloated and corrupt bureaucracy, increased tax revenues, and the curbing of local monarchs who have often ruled with autocratic powers."

Ultimately, the Philippines have not only shown the very worst side of Germany in our treatment of the indigenous populace, but have been wholly unprofitable, as whatever revenue we extract from the islands is spent on keeping down the numerous Jacobin revolutionaries. It is time that we end this tragic expedition and begin negotiations with leaders of the Flipino nationalists for the full independence of their nation."

Firstly, we must institute a provisional hike in taxation across the board in order to pay off our debts and ensure we can balance the budget for a more sound economic future.

  germany.1.t:0 "The Kaiser's New Years Address"
  germany.1.d:0 "As the new year begins, celebrations throughout Germany have begun to peeter out. Early in the morning, Kaiser Rudolf II appeared before a gathered crowd in Frankfurt to deliver his new years address. His speech contained little in terms of tangible promises to the people, keeping in line with his generally apolitical stance, but of particular note was his consistent references to the need for \" more modern leadership for the Empire.\"\n\nThese cues, coupled with the Kaiser's general withdrawal from public life, has lead to concerns among the nobility of weakness. Though the Kaiser has rebuffed any concerns from his advisors to the contrary, it has become something of an open secret that the Kaiser has sought retirement from his position for some time. The Kaiser's retreat from publicity has lead to greater indirect power being vested in the hands of the Autonomous Kingdoms, with King Rupprecht of Bavaria supposedly mocking the Kaiser as \"feminine and weak\" for focusing more on his family life.\n\nRegardless, the government does not run on rumors, and Chancellor Stresemann believes that he can finally push his reform plan through the Bundestag this year."
  germany.1.a:0 "Perhaps 1933 will finally be our year..."

  germany.2.t:0 "Bread Riots in the Rhineland"
  germany.2.d:0 "Political violence is not unheard of in Germany, and almost a decade of economic downturn has lead to many instances of rioting. In Koblenz, however, a series of bread riots rapidly got out of control, leading to nearly twenty five deaths and dozens of injured.\n\nRelief efforts in the Rhineland have been ongoing for the last year due to crop failures, and the region continues to suffer from one of the nation's higher poverty rates. According to witnesses, bread being distributed in a poorer neighborhood of Koblenz escalated into violence when bread supplies began to run out. After being denied their ration, reportedly several men assaulted the relief workers before being shot by the police. In the ensuing chaos, four police officers were tackled and beaten while relief offices were ransacked.\n\nMinister-President Goebbels has sent a furious letter to the offices of Frankfurt, demanding the deployment of the Nationalgarde to Koblenz."

When questioned, he stated that the Kaiser confided in him that he planned to abdicate the throne. According to the Chancellor, the Kaiser was open that the stress of rule and his advancing age had begun to severely affect his health.\n\nHis statements are not without merit, Stresemann stated, as the Kaiser had been hospitalized in 1930 following a bout of pneumonia. Though the incident was largely kept out of the papers, the event had \"made his majesty acutely aware of his mortality.\"\n\nThough there are no legitimate concerns regarding succession, Stresemann believes that the abdication is \"exactly the kind of chaotic mess we can't afford right now.\""

Now people were remembering one important detail surrounding all of this. The Kaiser had only one heir, his daughter Elisabeth Marie.\n\nA woman. After 250 Years a woman would again come to bear the title of Kaiser. However everyone knew she would not become the next Maria Theresa. While personal friends often give her the nickname of 'Erzsi', the public and especially her greatest doubters call her the'Red Princess'. Elisabeth has made some years ago pubibly that she believes in the values of socialism, peace and unity. Despite being forbidden to join a party, she has several contacts and friends in the labour party and she herself organized food banks for poor people during this depression.\n\nDespite protests of several politicians, Rudolf insisted that she would suceed him as Kaiserin. And so when all Germans were able to see the coronation of their new Kaiserin on television, it is not unfounded to say that they had the same thoughts in those moments.\n\n What will happen now?"

  germany.5.d:0 "Though most Germans are at the very least acquiescent to Kaiserin Elisabeth's ascension to the throne, not all are willing to accept a woman at the head of the German state. The most vocal opposition to the new monarch is from Prince Georg, who insists that not only is Elisabeth wholly incapable of ruling, but that a woman has no place on the throne at all. Normally, such a statement would be considered outright sedition, but to the horror of many left-leaning politicians, a large segment of the right-wing parties in the Bundestag have stood behind his claim. Their concerns largely stem not from shared sentiments of misogyny but from Elisabeth's openly left-wing rhetoric. Though by law, members of the Royal Family are forbidden from joining any political party or holding elected office, this has not stopped Her Majesty from calling for socialist reforms and trying to present herself as an \"Empress of the People\".\n\n Though this has earned her the love of the working class, the conservative coalition led by the DV in the Bundestag is vehemently opposed to such statements from the throne. Elisabeth's reign may turn out very short indeed depending on how the Bundestag votes on the matter of Prince Georg's claim."

Of particular note was Magnus Hirschfeld, a leading figure in sexual studies. Born in Kolberg, Brandenburg-Prussia, Hirschfeld spent the interwar years pioneering his research of alternative sexuality.\n\nHirschfeld’s most notable work in recent years has been his advocacy for the concept of “spectrum sexuality.” Spectrum Sexuality argues for the idea of gender and sexual preference as a fluid concept and independent of one-another, going against the traditional sexology studies on the subject. In addition to this, Hirschfeld has been a prominent advocate of homosexual rights throughout Germany, often butting heads with more conservatively minded politicians. Up until recently, the Hirschfeld Institute of Sexual Studies has been funded by private investors, however now Hirschfeld himself has approached the German government to seek official support."

Before the stranger could escape, he was apprehended by the local police and taken in for questioning. The man he targeted, 44 year old local Adolf Hitler, died from his wounds shortly after the attack. Hitler, a local painter in the Vienna Artist Commune, served a brief term of service in the Reichsheer before being forced to retire due to wounds suffered from a French gas attack\n\nThe unidentified stranger, who spoke with an abnormal German dialect, explained frantically about \"going to the wrong timeline\" and showed investigators a series of photos of what appeared to be people behind barbed wire and some kind of large mushroom-shaped explosion. When it was explained that he would be indicted for murder, the man claimed he \"shouldn't have rounded up his calculations\" before gunning down the two interviewing officers with a hidden automatic pistol and escaping the police station. Police were unable to find where the man had escaped to, but did find that he had left a leather jacket with a few personal affects.\n\nAmong the stranger's possessions was a small black device with a plastic exterior and a button that would open it to reveal a key. Several buttons on the top would cause a small red light to flash as well. The items were handed off to Evidenzburo officials the following day, who plan to continue investigating the bizarre murder."

The assassin has been caught by the local police, and is believed to be a radical who opposes the current German government. After the police took a glance at his past records, he has been arrested for petty crimes and has spent time in a mental facility near Munich, where he was released a few weeks prior, from which he returned to his home town of Wurzburg, and made the decision sadly some people had to witness.\n\nThe police have also said that they believe he wasn’t acting alone, and that this action was not just because of his illness, they believe someone talked him into doing this, however there is not yet any evidence to support this claim. Witnesses say that not even the Great War compares to the way Mr. Schroeter was murdered, so brutal, so toughtless and so inhumane. It has been rumoured that a kid present during the murder was watching it happen, and hasn’t left his room since then.\n\n The local government is deciding whether to bring the man to justice or whether to hang him because of his crimes, no choice will seem to be made anytime soon. The public is firmly against justice, and wants his head off, maybe even with a public execution, however from the local government no response has yet to come to this idea.

Our forces were met with little resistance, some groups decided to fight back, but after a brief standoff their leaders were convinced to stand down and come quietly. The Rhenish Freikorps Groups, thankfully, were not organized and united enough to try and test our patience. It seems like their numbers themself were very low, being harassed by equal strong socialist militias\n\nThe people region is generally happy about the dissolution of the Freikorps in the region who everyone from Consertative to Jacobin saw them as nothing more then as criminals and troublemakers.

With rising nationalism in Europe it seems like the Czech People are more and more seeing themself as a seperate culture groups then us Germans. Despite being a part of the Holy Roman Empire for more then 600 Years the Czechs never truly became Germans and are now seeming to beginn a path of seperatism. Czech Language is spoken more in school, German Adminstrators are being replaced by young competent Czechs and so on. The biggest problem is however the Czech Legion.\n\nThe Czech Legion is the equivalent of the Freikorps Groups in other German Cities with the key difference that they are fighting against German Influence in Czechia. Harassment of German Citiziens, organizing strikes against German-Factories and even terrorism. However they are not a terrorism group truthfully and were able to inspire Czech Nationalism in their region due the neglience of the old Government.\n\nDespit Army Commanders and a majority of politicians advocating of an violent purge of this group, the Thalmann wants to avoid spilling more blood in Germany and fears it could lead to more radical terrorism. The Government has arranged a meeting with the most prominent leaders of the Czech Legion, led by Josef Šnejdárek. He seems to be aware that a rebellion against Germany will likely not be sucessful and rather demands more autonomy for the Czech inside the United Kingdoms. However the demands he has are hard to accept as they severly restrict German Centralization over the Region and reduce German Buisnesses."

Casualties were high and the morale of the Czechs appeared to grow stronger. Seeing such heavy resistance, the government finally decided to show no more restraint in the matter. In the next hours special mortar teams, armored cars and even flamethrowers arrived on the scene. The Second Battle was over quickly with the complete destruction of the Czech Legions.\n\nWhile some elements of the Legion might have gone underground the leadership decided to fight until the bitter end. Josef Šnejdárek personally fought with his machine gun until he was burned alive by a Flammenwerfer Unit. Some politicians are already showing some kind of regret for this kind of bloody battle. Not out of sympathy but rather out of fear that we just elevated the dead of the Legion to martyrs of their cause."

But she had failed. The cries of the workers will go forever unheard, the very radical ideologies that threatened liberty on the continent have tainted the seats of government.\n\nShe sat in her large Imperial office, decorated in all manner afforded to a leader of such a major power. If a lowly peasant had seen this room, they’d think the gates of heaven had greeted them.

But now it was over.\n\n“Your Majesty,” spoke one of the government officials who sat in front of her desk, “we are awaiting your signature.”\n\nElisabeth sighed as he looked out at the window, seeing the marching tides of Nationalism everywhere. Propaganda posters, armed guards patrolling the streets, it was worse than seeing the capital burn. With a heavy heart she at her desk, looking at the document that was pushed toward her. It was filled with bureaucratic nonsense to try and make those reading it sign it out of boredom. But she knew exactly what it was saying, for she was not a fool. In essence signing this document would result in one thing.\n\nAbdication.\n\n“If you sign now, we can guarantee that you will be allowed to live in internal exile at one of your summer homes.

Rathenau waited patiently for these voices of discontent to stay silent, his gaze searched through the Reichstag before falling upon Hungenberg for a brief moment. And then, the Chancellor began his response:\n\n“Honourable and noble members of this Diet, you have heard very...colourful terms used in response to one of our most recent pieces of legislation, talk of spies and conspiracy amongst the Jewish population of our nation, especially from the right honourable Hugenberg. But I come to you requesting a chance to speak and offer my perspective on our nation’s actions. And fortunately I have been granted an opportunity to do so.\n\nMany of those who do not approve of the actions of our government claim that Jews are traitors, thieves, with more than a few of them disputing their very humanity, along with their citizenship and the status of this land as their home. You call us traitors and cowards, but ignore our sacrifices during the war. Hundreds if not thousands of Jews volunteered, giving life and limb for Germany. You claim we have taken our money, while it is Jewish businesses that contribute to our economy. And you say that Germany is not our land, that there is no greater honour than driving us out. But we have lived here for centuries, long before any of you were born. Even in the days of the Holy Roman Empire, my people were here; we have earned our place in Germany.\n\nYou claim that such beliefs and practices are noble, but where is the honour in driving away honest hard working people who sacrificed everything for a country that berates them! That does everything they can to fix our ailing economy, just as any other German would! All while you ignore the storm clouds forming over Europe, the Revanchism of France grows as it eyes to absorb our territory. If you truly cared for Germany, you would see the real threat rather than chasing make believe boogeymen who only exist in your imagination! Bring us together, instead of dividing us apart.”\n\nThe ministers and politicians cheered, waving the flags of Germany, celebrating this speech as a victory in itself. Over the tide of anti-semitism, as Rathenau looked out to the crowd, he could see the quiet fury of Hungenberg, he knew this would be an uphill battle. But this was a start."

The rampant illiteracy inside the colonies has improved very little.\nFurthermore the treatment of the African Workers is still subhuman. Standardized Working Conditions have not been implemented and in several places Africans are forced to work for entire days with no rest bordering Slavery. This practice does not even really benefit the Empire economicially it hinders the progression of its potential working class and only helps to increase the pockets of African Landlords.\nLastly the greatest issue plagueing all colonies has been a severe need of bureaucracy.

He requires naval bases, fortifications, dockyards, ships, fuel and so much more to defend against the glooming Japanese Threat as he calles it.\n\nSeveral gentlemen here wonder if the claims of Dönitz are really to be taken serious and are not just hysteria. It seems like that even if Japan would do the most unthinkable that would never get past the British Islands and their navy and so it is seen as a necassity to reinforce the Far East.\n\nHowever there still might be problems in the Former French Colony in Australia. The Republic of Australie appears to be be quite bitter about their defeat and losses in WW1 and some say that they still regard themself as part of the French Realm. If this would be true we would have a huge security risk next to our new naval bases in Australia."

  germany.182.t:0 "The Focus of our Colonial Involvement?"
  germany.182.d:0 "What is our focus on Colonial Matters in the next years? Groener promises great profits and a bright future in his African Colonies but Dönitz warns about the threats in the Far East which could risk our influence in East Asia. The choice lies with us here in Frankfurt. Should our greatest colonial investments be directed towars the African Continent or should we divert them to the Pacific?"

  germany.183.t:0 "The Lyon Trials"
  germany.183.d:0 "The conference on the status of French and Russian war criminials of the Second Great War, simply known as the Lyon Trials, were held 10:00 a.m. within the French city of Lyon. The city miraculously avoided any major urban firefights or long drawn out sieges thanks to the mayors willingness to surrender the French garrison in the city without much of a fight. The location was decided upon after the both the German and British government had jointly decided that Paris was simply not suitable to host any form of official conference, let alone one that would decide the fate of the many war criminals that had come about during the war. Parisian infrastructure was virtually none existent and both parties quickly decided that the largely intact Lyon would suit the conference best, with the court hearings and procceedings being held within the once defunct parliament house.\n\nThe first matter of the Trials was the topic of the SP and their role in the war. Many disturbing atrocities, especially towards jews, had taken place under SP leadership and whilst the investigation into some of the worst of these atrocities are sill on going the verdict had been made clear by the court; death by hanging for those responsible for crimes against humanity. The next topic of discussion was that of the French and Russian military, numerous violations of the rules of war were broken on many occasions by important individuals originating from the armed forces of these nations and it can be argued that such individuals were responsible for France's warmongering attitude. The court decided on a case by case basis and many high ranking military officials had either received the death penalty or life imprisonment. The final discussion point of the day was that of the individuals who held government jobs and the country leaders themselves. Both economists under the French and Russian government utilised slavery in different forms to full their war machines. They were also complacent in the mistreatement of prisoners of war as well as occupied populations and arguably encouraged it. These government officials mostly got away from having the death penalty besides some extreme cases. Finally was the topic of the leaders of France and Russia. This was the most long and drawn out area of the Lyon Trials and lawyers on either side passionately argued that both parties were responsible for the enviroment that lead these nations to the path of war, they also pointed out the hypocrisy in the British and German empires who had achieved their world status by conquering other nations much in the same vein as the French and Russian governments. However the court did not budge and came to the conclusion that both leaders were to be hanged and their bodies cremated in undisclosed locations. By the end of the week the trials had concluded and most of the individuals responsible for the horrors of the Second Great War were either dead or locked up indefinitely. Europe must now rebuild itself, piece by piece, and undo the mistakes of the past else it face the monster of vengeance once again."
  germany.183.a:0 "Death is justice"

  germany.184.t:0 "The Italian Dispute"
  germany.184.d:0 "The Italian Kingdom has always claimed the regions of Tyrol, Istria, and Friaul ever since their unification. Whilst we are on friendly terms with the Italian government the topic of who should govern these regions have remained a persistent thorn in our diplomatic relations. The time has now come to decide whether these lands should stay under our control of be ceded to the Italians."

  germany_exile.1.d:0 ""A day will come when sacred Troy shall perish, and Priam and his people shall be slain." Scipio to his Greek mentor Polybius after the defeat of Carthage.\n\nIt is written in history that all empires will come to an end, that all things good are inherently mortal, our empire being one such thing. Frankfurt now mimics that of a descrated corpse, once beautiful and plump it now rots with a foul stench. Waiting for someone to bury it in the dirt never to be seen again. The French may either be our grave digger, or a mere passer-by, whatever the case may be one thing for sure is that we are far from home, if we can still remember what home is. With our armies beaten and our people hungry we must fight hard and die well, for there is no other choice for a dead man to do."

  germany_exile.2.t:0 "Germany offers us an alliance"
  germany_exile.2.d:0 "The Imperial German government, now forced into exile as we were by the Fatimist fanatics, have approached us with an offer of alliance. This would almost certainly be in our mutual interest. Both our nations have now been forced out from their homelands, and some in our army and government have become demoralized from the belief that we may never see our home again. Were we to accept this offer, the extensive fleets and resources of the German government-in-exile would be at our full disposal for the destruction of our mutual enemies.\n\n How shall we answer?"
  germany_exile.2.a:0 "I see no reason why we shouldn't accept"

  germany_exile.3.t:0 "Portugal accepts our proposal"
  germany_exile.3.d:0 "The Portuguese exiles have reviewed our request for an alliance and have decided to accept it on the common grounds that both nations wish to return to their homelands Though there was some concern the Portuguse may refuse, given concerns of security, their government-in-exile has made the wise choice to stand with us and work together to return to our rightful homelands. Perhaps there may be hope for liberation yet."
  germany_exile.3.a:0 "Fantastic news!"

  germany_exile.4.t:0 "Germany demands our submission"
  germany_exile.4.d:0 "The German government-in-exile has demanded that we allow for the unification of our two countries. They have threatened military intervention into our territory if we do not comply. Though perhaps most countries would respond to such a demand with a resolute \"no,\" our nation was founded by German settlers and many Sudwestafrikans still view Germany as our Mother Country. Rather than face an unecessary war with our brothers, it seems the pragmatic option would be to at last rejoin our German brothers and help them liberate the Fatherland."
  germany_exile.4.a:0 "Do we have a choice?"

  germany_exile.5.t:0 "Sudwestafrika bends the knee"
  germany_exile.5.d:0 "Sudwestafrika has accepted our demands, citing that they always wished to return back to Germany. Their dire sitaution may be some cause of concern, especially for our already struggling economy but analysts believe the effects would only be minor. What matters is that we have reunited these brave settlers with their Fatherland, even if home may seem impossibly far from us."
  germany_exile.5.a:0 "Their masters have returned"

  germany_exile.6.t:0 "Germany demands our submission"
  germany_exile.6.d:0 "The German government-in-exile has demanded that we submit to their authority without delay. If we were to refuse, it is near certain that the German Army-in-exile would make quick work of us. Though weakened by their exile, they still have a powerful navy that could pound us into dust. Naturally, it seems that there is little alternative to contacting the German ambassador and making it clear we have no intentions of refusing their demands."
  germany_exile.6.a:0 "Do we have a choice"

  germany_exile.7.t:0 "The Dutch fold"
  germany_exile.7.d:0 "The Dutch government has reluctantly accepted our demands of submission. They have made their position clear however that this occupation must be temporary and if it isn't then armed conflict would arise. Regardless, the government is ecstatic. The acquisition of Dutch territory shall surely be a great boon to our efforts against those that occupy the Fatherland."

POLITICS_KARL_DONITZ_DESC:0 ""The North German does not go in for extremes. He has broader horizons than the men from the mountains of Bavaria and Austria."\n\n§YBorn:§!16/9/1891\n\nKarl Dönitz earned his glory, in the Great War he served in the German Navy like no other sailor could show. He is efficient, ruthless and seems to feel not a bit of pressure. At the end of the war he became of Germany's Greatest War Heroes. He continued to serve in the Navy gaining prestige and ranks through his persistance on continuous development of Naval Technology and Doctrines. With his rising tensions in the recent years in the Pacific the now Admiral Dönitz was dispatched as Statthalter to the Pacific Commonwealth. There he hopefully shall root out rising internal resistance and shield the colonies from foreign aggression.\n\nHowever if we look under the facade of Admiral Dönitz we might learn more about what a man he truly is."
