PB_AME_john_curtin_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 8/1/1885\n\n§YJohn Curtin§! has been involved in the American political sphere from as young as 13, joining the Boston Trade Union after leaving school and eventually finding a job in the then young All-American Socialist League. However, his time in socialist politics quickly ended seeing that many held rather pro-war views during the Great War in a bid to earn more popular support nationally and abroad. John Curtin would politically bounce around until finally finding a place in the American Liberal Party. Semi-famous for his anti-war stance during the Great War, he was one of the few outspoken critics of Operation Overlord in American politics at the time. It is likely that this anti-war stance Curtin has adopted brought him the few extra necessary votes from the remaining American veteran population that earnt him the highest seat in politics.\n\nCurrently Curtin has campaigned on three promises, one is the total overhaul of the Commonwealth war debts that have piled high since the Treaty of Tours and stands as his most popular campaign point. Second is his determination to finally resolve the Southern Issue, a contentious political dream that scared many within the Liberal party from initially putting forward John Curtin as their Prime Minister of choice. And finally, there is the question of the Native reservations that he has promised to resolve once and for all."

PB_AME_Nicaragua_Occupation_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nNicaragua at this current time is an occupied nation. While it was originally to receive a generous 3% of canal profits, this was not enough for the Estrada government. With the consent of London, the Commonwealth armed a coalition of interned Dixie insurrectionists and turned them loose to topple Estrada. The decision has given us sufficient plausible deniability to effectively occupy the country, while using the insurrectionists as a cover. In Nicaragua, the people are increasingly unruly under American control, further complicating security around the Canal Zone. The American public is currently unaware of the extent of the occupation, but the bloodier things get and the longer the operation carries on, the more likely that someone catches on.\n\nCurrently, there are two active insurrectionist groups following the collapse of the Sandinistas in October. The §OZeledonistas§! represent the democratic opposition, primarily lead by the aging general Benjamín Zeledón.\nThe §bFederalistas§! represent a coalition of Central American generals, motivated by grand ambition and profit to restore the formerly unified Central American Republic.\n\nWe must stabilize Nicaragua by keeping both resistance factions from overtaking the American Occupation Administration. If §rDespotist popularity drops below 10%§!, Stephenson's government will be in danger of being §roverthrown§!. Should this happen, Nicaragua will break free and potentially attempt to re-occupy the canal zone, severely stalling progress.\n\n§YThe Stephenson Government's§! Popularity is currently at §Y[?NIC.party_popularity@ds|%]§!\n§OZeledonista§! Popularity is currently at §O[?NIC.party_popularity@lb|%]§!\n§bFederalista§!

These groups maintain significant lobbying influence on their provincial and national parliaments, ergo keeping their favor is key for conducting the government as we desire. There are currently six major groups that hold influence in this manner.\n\nFreedmen represent the provinces primarily controlled by AfrRam groups, standing in opposition to the larger Southern lobby that controls most of the Old South.\n\nWarhawks represent the expansionist elements of the government, and keeping them empowered will allow us a freer hand in using force for diplomacy. Peaceniks, naturally, will attempt to restrain military action in diplomacy whenever possible.\n\nMegacorporations represent the influence of corporate groups on the Commonwealth, opposed by various trade unions. While the Unions lack the international influence of the Megacorps, they still represent a critical voting block for parliament.\n\n[get_freedmen_support]\n[get_freedmen_radicals]\n\n[get_dixie_support]\n[get_dixie_radicals]\n\n[get_warhawk_support]\n\n[get_peacenik_support]\n\n[get_megacorp_support]\n\n[get_union_support]\n"

PB_AME_The_Dawes_Ministry:0 "The Coolidge Ministry"
PB_AME_Double_the_Segregation:0 "Double Down on Segregation"
PB_AME_Double_the_Segregation_desc:0 "The segregation debate is one not worth wading into, for it’ll only dirty the reputation of our administration in fighting for either side. Therefore we will maintain a position of neutrality on the issue. Southerners and Freedmen may hate us for our noncommittal, and even aloof, stance but our voting base in the north will remain secure enough for us not to need their support.\n\nHopefully the fools will stop fighting soon…"
PB_AME_Maintain_Crittenden_Neutrality:0 "Maintain Crittenden Neutrality"
PB_AME_Maintain_Crittenden_Neutrality_desc:0 "With tension rising between the Freedmen and the White citizenry, many have called for us to step in. But they do not realise that we cannot do so, leaning too far one way would lead to disaster. Siding with the non-coloured citizens would spark race riots, possibly even rebellion. While siding with the Negros will cause the White citizens to use their economic influence to weaken our government, and could even spark conflict with New Dixie. So instead, we must walk the face, balance both sides and avoid any form of escalation. Some may call this cowardice, but the preferred term is appeasement."
PB_AME_Adress_the_Segregation_Issue:0 "Address the Segregation Issue"
PB_AME_Adress_the_Segregation_Issue_desc:0 "The armed conflicts between the Freedmen and White provinces are costing us greatly. Both financially and otherwise, despite the end of the Southern Rebellion in 1838. In the halls of government calls for action grow louder. We can no longer ignore them. But we shall not fight fire with fire, instead we shall take action to resolve the matter peacefully. We will sit down with those involved and hash out an agreement. Something that will not only ensure the stability of our Sothern territories but address the wider issue surrounding this conflict."
PB_AME_Addressing_the_Indian_Issue:0 "Revisiting Indian Policy"
PB_AME_Addressing_the_Indian_Issue_desc:0 "Dating back to the days of the first colonists in America, our relationship with the Native Indians has been a complex one. Today, they live on reservations. But some of the more liberal members of both our government and the one in London have called for us to rethink this approach and work to revive their culture.\n\nHowever, there are others who believe that we should instead focus on assimilation. While we do not know for sure what path to take, the Indian question is not something that can be ignored and sooner or latter we will have to give an answer."
PB_AME_Promote_Bi_Lingualism:0 "Promote Bi-Lingualism"
PB_AME_Discourage_Native_Language_Education:0 "Discourage Native Languages in School"
PB_AME_Discourage_Native_Language_Education_desc:0 "Maintaining native-language education has been more of a hindrance than a benefit, as programs to integrate the Indians into civilised society have long since stalled to a halt. Clearly more encouragement is needed for these tribes to embrace our way of life. All native-language media shall be defunded and replaced with English-only services, while in school native children will be discouraged in speaking their native tongue in and outside of the classroom. In time, there’ll be no-one left uttering anything other than the Queen’s English."
PB_AME_Develop_Haudenosaunia:0 "Develop Haudenosaunia"
PB_AME_Develop_Haudenosaunia_desc:0 "Haudenosaunia, more commonly known as the Seven Nations Territories, remains as one of the poorest regions in the north. The decentralised native government has been unable to meet the challenges of administering and modernising the disparate communities with traditional lifestyles remaining dominant, so it is only appropriate that we step in.\n\nTo incentivise new industry, grants will be given out to companies to invest and build in these regions. Combined with the natives acting as un-unionised labour, the venture will not only improve their lives but also be greatly profitable for those involved."
PB_AME_Develop_the_Seminole_Province:0 "Develop the Seminole Provinces"
PB_AME_Develop_the_Seminole_Province_desc:0 "East Florida is a unique case as it is the only majority native province in the entire Commonwealth, with many special provisions and laws that have allowed its tourist industry to thrive. Miami finds itself packed with visitors from all over the globe who come for the sunny beaches, casinos and cheap luxuries.\n\nHowever the swampy interior has been continuously neglected in favour of the coastal resorts. Poverty is rampant in interior communities, and combined with an epidemic of alcoholism have created a huge disparity between the two regions. With assistance from the central government the province will begin to bring the interior up to standard with the coast: local industries such as tobacco farming will be supported and mechanised, while new industries will bring the wonders of the modern age to the natives."
PB_AME_Native_Electrification_Bureau:0 "Establish the NEB"
PB_AME_Native_Electrification_Bureau_desc:0 "If the natives are truly to enter the 20th century we must bring the light of modernity to them, quite literally. Programs to provide wireless electricity to native regions have largely fallen flat under provincial oversight with local governors preferring to direct the funds toward their own settlements. Again, it is the duty of the central government to step in and guide them forward.\n\nThe creation of the Native Electrification Bureau will sideline the provincial governments to directly manage the construction of wireless electrical infrastructure and begin the phasing out of old wired systems. In time the natives will become fully integrated in all ways: culturally, administratively, and now infrastructurally."
PB_AME_Concessions_to_White_Provinces:0 "Concede to White Provinces"
PB_AME_Concessions_to_Coloured_Provinces:0 "Reach out to Coloured Provinces"
PB_AME_Concessions_to_Coloured_Provinces_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Southern Rebellion a massive demographic shift occurred across the south, with Freedmen migrating en-masse to the Mississippi interior to form new communities away from the white terror. In time these became the coloured provinces of Bailey and Taliaferro, two lone bastions of loyalty in an otherwise hostile land.\n\nBut the provinces have remained an enigma since. The educated class of urban blacks has largely lorded over the rural descendents of field slaves in a strange recreation of the old plantation houses, only on a much bigger scale. While this system of governance is often derided as “despotic” it will allow us to mobilise the Freedmen voter base very efficiently in cooperation with local representatives. With a few subsidies here, a bunch of tax breaks there and we’ll soon have a fine political machine running."
PB_AME_Encourage_Linconia_Immigration:0 "Offer Marooner Recognition"
PB_AME_Encourage_Linconia_Immigration_desc:0 "Since the Negro Rebellion the Marooner Republic has been free from New Dixie's rule, but our government has been unwilling to recognise them as legitimate in fear of increasing tensions and potentially reigniting the southerners’ rebellious tendencies. But now it seems the facade cannot be kept up. As tensions between the two threaten to boil over into war, the possibility of a resurgent, hostile force from beyond the Mississippi becomes unignorable. As the lesser of two evils, we recognise the Marooners’ independence.\n\nAlthough the southerners will likely hate us for it, the large population of voting Freedmen will be pleased to see our passive support for the Marooner cause even if we have no commitment to provide aid. For now, this small victory will endear us greatly to them."
PB_AME_Carte_Blanche_for_the_White_Belt:0 "Carte Blanche for the White Belt"
PB_AME_Carte_Blanche_for_the_White_Belt_desc:0 "Violence is no stranger to the south, with honour killings and lynch mobs being a common form of justice where police presence is weak. While this disregard for law and order is despicable, many of our southern colleagues wish for us to turn a blind eye to these excesses in order for their continued support. For the time being we will accede to their demands.\n\nAs a precaution to any Freedmen protest, southern authorities will also be given special powers for a period. So long as they keep the peace, anything goes."
PB_AME_Expand_the_Coloured_Brigade_Program:0 "Increase Coloured Brigade Funding"
PB_AME_Expand_the_Coloured_Brigade_Program_desc:0 "While the coloured provinces maintain their own provincial guards there are currently no Freedman divisions in our armed forces, which is a great waste of potential manpower. Our administration will see to it that two Freedmen divisions are formed from the merger of these provincial forces and given adequate funding to be a fighting force equal to any other divisions in our army.\n\nThis historical first will be a great source of pride for many Freedmen, who's loyalty to the crown and the commonwealth will finally be recognised. With them on our side the southerners would dare not rebel again."
PB_AME_Repatriate_White_League_Prisoners:0 "Repatriate White League Prisoners"
PB_AME_Repatriate_White_League_Prisoners_desc:0 "The rebel state of New Dixie officially denies their support of the various insurgent groups that dot the south, but in truth they are the lynchpin of the entire anti-British movement. In order to maintain peace across the Mississippi we will agree to a series of prisoner transfers, with us returning interned White Leaguers while they release pro-civil rights agitators. Hopefully by extending the olive branch to them they will begin to wind down their activities in the south."
PB_AME_Increase_the_Southern_Development_Fund:0 "Increase the Dixie Development Fund"
PB_AME_Increase_the_Southern_Development_Fund_desc:0 "While we have provided some political concessions to the south, it has proven to not yet be enough. Calls for further action remain, the most immediate demands being from the rural population. They wish to see the economic development of the north replicated with them.\n\nTo ensure their support, we shall do so. By increased the Southern Development Fund, we will improve factories, farms and infrastructure across the entire region. By improving the lives of the rural southern population, we can practically guarantee their support. The improved economic output is a nice bonus too."
PB_AME_Promote_EIEC_Integration:0 "Promote EIEC Ventures"
PB_AME_Promote_EIEC_Integration_desc:0 "Edison Electric may have a disreputable standing in the eyes of those concerned with "moral issues", but there is certainly no denying their efficiency and industrial prowess. They may be profit-driven snakes, they may be questionable in their treatment of employees, but they are a definite boon to our economy... and that's what matters!\n\nBy granting special concessions, and promoting buyouts to them, we can provide a definite incentive for them to expand their business empire and prop up our partially ailing economy. It'll have no drawbacks we're told, but we must keep a watchful eye on them nonetheless."
PB_AME_Preferential_Contracts_EIEC:0 "Exclusive Contracts to EIEC"
PB_AME_Preferential_Contracts_EIEC_desc:0 "Our military is, for the most part, bound to the will of London. It is as well equipped as desired by His Majesty, and our capabilities from a standpoint of armaments can often be... lacking.\n\nHowever, Edison Electric is a fine loophole to this issue. While trusted by Britain, the EIEC hold no true loyalties to them and act in the name of profit, nothing more, nothing less. By further integrating the EIEC into our military-industrial complex we could benefit considerably and reduce our reliance on direct supply from London."
PB_AME_Expand_New_Jersey_Technical_Institute:0 "Expand the New Jersey Technical Institute"
PB_AME_Expand_New_Jersey_Technical_Institute_desc:0 "What finer source of intellect does a nation have other than its youth? Those young whippersnappers soak up knowledge like a sponge and, of course, this cycles back into our markets and government.\n\nThe Edison-founded New Jersey Technical Institute is one of the greatest points of cultivation we have for these brilliant minds. Expanding funding for the establishment will go a long way in improving our scientific standing in the Commonwealth, and let us not forget the international community."

PB_AME_Reignite_the_MegaCorp_Trade_War:0 "Reignite the MegaCorp War"
PB_AME_Reignite_the_MegaCorp_Trade_War_desc:0 "It has become overwhelmingly evident that our faith in the EIEC has been... misplaced, to say the least. But our righteous government isn't foolish enough to place all of our eggs in one basket. Having sufficiently subsidized other mega-corporations, we can simply bid off previous EIEC contracts to them and divvy out the allocations amongst our eager, wealthy patrons.\n\nLet the bidding begin!"
PB_AME_Edison_Mass_Electrification_Plan:0 "Edison Mass Electrification Scheme"
PB_AME_Edison_Mass_Electrification_Plan_desc:0 "While our cities and factories continue to prosper, the rural countryside has been neglected. The farms in the region lack the technological advances we have access to on the East Coast. If our nation's economy is to grow, we must remedy this situation. With help from the EIEC, we hope to commence a mass electrification plan, bringing efficient and wireless energy to farms and rural hamlets across the nation. Allowing our agriculture to grow and to bring more of our great nation into the 20th century."
PB_AME_Infuse_Money_into_Chicago:0 "Infuse Money into the Melbourne Megaplex"
PB_AME_Infuse_Money_into_Chicago_desc:0 "Our nation’s megacity is far from the symbol of American exceptionalism that we wish it was. To many a social reformer it is a den of depravity; a city bearing the sins of Sodom and the hubris of Babylon from which great towers that scratch the heavens grow, while below in the slums the impoverished citizenry make a home in hell.\n\nTo begin restructuring Melbourne into a functional city an injection of capital will be provided for a new wave of construction projects, many of which will be housing for the poor. Combined with new slum-clearing efforts and business friendly policies the city will finally become something to be proud of."
PB_AME_Contract_with_Dolbear_Bell:0 "Contracts with Dolbear-Bell"
PB_AME_American_Technical_Exceptionalism:0 "American Technical Exceptionalism" 
PB_AME_American_Technical_Exceptionalism_desc:0 "Though our industry may be vast and our population motivated, we cannot make a name for ourselves through steel alone. As the world's technology continues to grow, we must do more than keep up, we must skip past them. Research and develop wonders once believed to be marvels of science fiction. And when the people of the world look up to see flying cars and a terraformed Venus, they're see the American flag. We shall put our best foot forward, allowing the technology of the Commonwealth to surpass not just Russia but also Great Britain herself!"
PB_AME_Support_to_Nicaragua:0 "Funnel Support to Nicaragua"
PB_AME_Support_to_Nicaragua_desc:0 "One of our primary economic interests in Central America is the vast project known as the Nicaragua Canal. A massive undertaking that, if fully completed, would shorten the journey for any ship travelling from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The opportunities for trade speak for themselves. However, it has been a costly endeavour both financially and otherwise.  Some have begun to make moral objections against the use of cheap labour and poor work conditions. We cannot allow any delays, luckily a meeting is to be held to discuss the matter. To ensure the canal's timely completion, we must support Nicaragua's filibuster of this event and to prevent any chance of delay."
PB_AME_Shift_towards_Nicaraguazation:0 "Shift towards Nicaraguazation"
PB_AME_Shift_towards_Nicaraguazation_desc:0 "The effects of our presence in Nicaragua have been largely negative. Attempts to expand our influence and secure control over the region have only resulted in an economic and military black hole. One that is hated by the populace of both nations, so it is with a heavy heart that we must withdrawal. But we shall not leave the nation undefended, we shall wane off their reliance on our support and leave them capable of defending themselves from any internal threats. Allowing us to have a stable ally while ensuring a generation of men are not sent to die in the jungles of Central America."
PB_AME_Authorize_further_Deployment:0 "Authorize Further Deployment"
PB_AME_Authorize_further_Deployment_desc:0 "With none surprised to hear, the Nicaraguans are more than dissatisfied with our occupation of their nation for the sake of the canal. Riots, protests, and all kinds of resistance have cemented themselves as commonplace, and there are unfortunately no signs of this dwindling anytime soon. We must deploy an additional garrison reserves, the Commonwealth's finest (and most brutal), to quash local resistance and to further secure our personal interests in the region."
PB_AME_No_Such_Thing_as_Protestors:0 "\"No Such Thing as Protestors!\""
PB_AME_No_Such_Thing_as_Protestors_desc:0 "Revolutions are like a fire. They only take a spark to ignite, they're dangerous, and they spread like a plague. Likewise, a spark is like a riot. One riot, with enough force, can explode into a thousand more and lead to dire consequences. Some would say that the right to "protest" should be an enshrined liberty, but really, what's the difference between a protest and a riot when you're dealing with occupation? Let our boys in blue have their way with these fermenters of revolution."

PB_AME_Make_Empty_Promises_desc:0 "Westminster have undoubtedly mastered the art of native pacification. From local rulers to regional concessions, the methods employed have been able to sustain a massive the British global hegemon thus far. So, like father like son, we need to take a page out of their notebook and offer some promises to the Nicaraguans.\n\nTheir cries for democracy and freedom will be met with our warm and understanding acceptance, whilst we cross our fingers and draw out the process of liberalisation for as long as possible; ideally, forever."
PB_AME_Philadelphia_Model_of_Democracy:0 "The American Model of Democracy"
PB_AME_Philadelphia_Model_of_Democracy_desc:0 "As part of our ongoing "liberalisation" efforts in Nicaragua, we shall install a parliamentary democracy based off of our system here in Philadelphia. Loyal collaborators and top Philadelphian administrators will begin drafting a constitution for them by which they can elect their own into the national government, and administer themselves. Importantly, their top brass will be approved by us, ensuring our continued grip over their internal affairs and increasing our role in their external policies."
PB_AME_Nicaraguan_Redevelopment_Fund:0 "Nicaraguan Reconstruction Plan"
PB_AME_Nicaraguan_Redevelopment_Fund_desc:0 "British occupation hasn't come without a cost. Constant localised insurrections and riots have led to countless cases of damage to industry and key institutions that has led to severe economic difficulties; not to mention exploitative practices by the Empire itself. By pumping some vital funds into the industry, we can prop up the administration and slowly but surely make Nicaragua reliant on us economically."
PB_AME_Expand_MinOne_Operations:0 "Expand Majestic 11 Operations"
PB_AME_Expand_MinOne_Operations_desc:0 "To walk into danger blinded is utterly foolish. You must know your enemy, and, thankfully, we have the perfect way to do just that. Ministry-One, our national intelligence service, is almost unparalleled in the field and can certainly serve as our eyes and ears in particularly rebellious regions. By expanding our funding and activities for Nicaraguan operations, we'll have a more secure understanding of rebel activities and how to combat them."
PB_AME_Authorize_Operation_Musketeer:0 "Greenlight Operation Musketeer"
PB_AME_Authorize_Operation_Musketeer_desc:0 "The Commonwealth's ambitions into Central America are being slowed by our inability to consolidate our holdings in Nicaragua. Right now, our occupational forces are opposed by two primary resistance groups, the Federalista and the Zeledonista. Until their efforts are severely weakened if not outright stopped, we cannot secure Nicaragua. At least, not without taking significant casualties. To this end, Operation Musketeer has been proposed. This will be a nation wide counter-insurgency operation, if successful Nicaragua's stability is all but guaranteed."
PB_AME_Focus_on_Federalistas:0 "Focus on Federalistas"
PB_AME_Focus_on_Federalistas_desc:0 "With resistance to our military presence in Nicaragua growing daily, we must strike while we still have wide public support. This can further be assured by proving ourselves as capable of defending the region against threats to peace. And the Federalistas are a perfect candidate for this. A reactionary group, there is little sympathy for them within our own borders. Meaning they can easily be vilified through propaganda and create an easy morale boost. Thus making them an obvious target for Operation Musketeer."
PB_AME_Focus_on_Zeledonistas:0 "Focus on Zeledonistas"
PB_AME_Focus_on_Zeledonistas_desc:0 "Our military presence in Nicaragua is by no means unopposed, one of the two major resistance groups we must deal with are the so called 'Zeledonistas'. Made up of more liberal minded activists and politicians from prior to our occupation, this movements bares some ideological similarities to some of our citizenry. Advocating for liberalisation of Nicaragua following the end of our occupation, it has began to earn sympathy from the people. If our influence is to remain intact, we must silence these insurgents before they are able to sway the American public to their side."

Serious solutions have been proposed, but they alternate from far too radical and revolutionary to clear white supremacist, Dixie appeasement. Thus, a kind of compromise has been drafted in the form of a race representative diet for the southern provinces, representating the white and black population of the area in a single parliament through a representative method. Some have criticized the project for its potential to empower white Dixie, while others have applauded the effort to repair race relations."

PB_AME_Establish_the_Black_Republics_desc:0 "A rather semi-controversial proposal among a sea of far more controversial proposals from Dixie politicians, Earnest S. Cox'x proposed \"Homeland Project\" has caught the eye of some in parliament and government. Following in the footsteps of the previous failures of the back-to-africa movements, the Homeland Republics would establish \"autonomous\" republics in the current freedmen provinces, giving the freedmen their own states while limiting our involvement in these regions, cutting spending down and ending the need for more freedmen representation in Philly, as small Freedmen parliament would give them the representation they need. Cox's proposal has been lambasted by the liberal wing of the party for its fake morality and clear intentions: this proposal would simply void freedmen citizenship, degrading the situation even further in the South."

Unicom.1.t:0 "The Automation Crisis hits America"
Unicom.1.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER The Automation Crisis in the United Kingdom begins, and the economic aftershocks strike the United Commonwealth. Following similar directives from Edison Corporate, various EIEC ventures in the UC begin shuttering human managed operations in favor of semi-automated machines. The sudden jolt of unemployment causes a shock to the economy, forcing several banks to temporarily close as unemployed workers attempt to withdraw savings in droves."
Unicom.1.a:0 "Get Edison representatives on the phone. Now."

Unicom.2.t:0 "Edison's Counterattack"
Unicom.2.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER Meeting with Edison representatives, Prime Minister Coolidge demands that they slow down their rate of layoffs or risk government action. The EIEC representatives inform him, in no uncertain terms, that action taken against the company could lead to a withdrawal from government contracts. In particular, Charles Edison, attending the meeting via telescreen, points out that Coolidge's heart augmentation is Edison brand. Caught between a rock and a hard place, the Prime Minister is forced to stand down and allow the EIEC to continue."
Unicom.2.a:0 "Smug bastards..."

Unicom.3.t:0 "Anti-Automation Riots"
Unicom.3.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER As the EIEC layoffs continue, nearly a million people take to the streets in the Midwest and New Jersey to protest Edison Electric. These protests frequently escalate into rioting, leading to mass unrest and the destruction of a number of expensive machines. The Royal American Mounted Police and Provincial Guards are deployed to contain things, but it becomes clear that things are escalating rapidly."
Unicom.3.a:0 "Deploy the Mounties, get these people off the streets."

Unicom.4.t:0 "The American Legion Mobilizes"
Unicom.4.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER The largest riots have calmed, however the veterans of the country have been disproportionately affected by the unemployment spike. Members of the American Legion, a veterans group created after the Great War, have begun meeting and announced their plan to approach the Coolidge administration. Veterans were promised sign-on bonuses during the Great War, to be delivered over a period of ten to twenty years based on service period. The Legion seeks to have these periods shortened, and to allow veterans to cash out the bonuses in these funds to better support themselves while unemployment is high."
Unicom.4.a:0 "Let's hear them out, at least."

Unicom.5.t:0 "General Butler endorses the Legion"
Unicom.5.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER General Smedley Butler has spoken out in support of the American Legion's proposal, arguing that the Commonwealth has a duty to support the veterans of the war. Despite the administration's concerns, Coolidge has offered to meet with Butler to discuss the prospect of working together to alleviate the veteran bonus concern. This idea is supported by Arthur Currie, another veteran of the Great War and upstart in the Unionist Party. On the other hand, Charles Hughes of the party's fiscal conservatives argues that the payout may be more than the Commonwealth's liquid reserves can accomodate."
Unicom.5.a:0 "Tell him to keep his nose out of politics."
Unicom.5.b:0 "Butler and Currie are reasonable men, let's talk."

Unicom.6.t:0 "The American Legion Arrives in Philadelphia"
Unicom.6.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER The American Legion delegation has arrived in Philadelphia, but with significant reinforcement. Nearly 20,000 demonstrators have flooded into the capital to support the delegation. While they generally aren't well armed, the RAMP have noted that many have significant wartime augmentation that could pose a threat to the public. Coolidge, now surrounded in his own country's capital by thousands of unemployed and angry veterans, now has to decide how to address the crisis. Routing the protestors would be deeply unpopular, but with the right media spin could be portrayed as defeating troublemakers. On the other hand, capitulation would make Coolidge look weak to the public and the Empire, and the UC may not be able to effectively foot the bill required. The third option, to negotiate, may be the best path for preventing bloodshed, but will require some compromises on both sides. "
Unicom.6.a:0 "A decision must be made, and soon."

Unicom.7.t:0 "Addressing the Ministry of Indian Affairs"
Unicom.7.d:0 ""
Unicom.7.a:0 "We should maintain the current bi-lingual curriculum"

Unicom_Elections.1.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER With the Crisis defeated by force, Coolidge faces harsh criticism from both sides of the aisle in parliament for using the military against American citizens."

Unicom_Socialists.5.b:0 "James M. Cox"
Unicom_Socialists.5.c:0 "J.S Woodsworth"

Unicom_Socialists.6.a:0 "Lang proposes the United Front"
Unicom_Socialists.6.d:0 "Following his victory in the parliamentary leadership election, Jack Lang has proposed to form a United Front with the radicals of the National Workman's party, arguing that these elements must become part of a single unified front against the EIEC and the threat of international capital.\n\nThe proposal has been met with some criticism by the moderates, who feel that capitulating to the closet republicans in the party might play poorly with the public."
Unicom_Socialists.6.a:0 "We'll work together, sure."
Unicom_Socialists.6.b:0 "No thanks."

Unicom_Socialists.7.t:0 "Determining the Next Prime Minister"
Unicom_Socialists.7.d:0 "With the Workman's Party succeeding in the parliamentary election, the time has come to choose a new prime minister. The Lang Labour faction has, unsurprisingly, nominated Jack Lang for the posting.\n\nThe Moderate faction, instead, has opted to nominate labour leader Bob Semple for the posting. Semple isn't a particularly inspiring leader, but perhaps the party needs someone unremarkable for the role. On the other hand, New Englander George Aiken has been proposed as an independent compromise candidate. Aiken's credentials as MP for the Vermont Province are quite significant, and his appointment could quell unrest from both the moderates and radicals."
Unicom_Socialists.7.a:0 "Jack Lang"
Unicom_Socialists.7.b:0 "Bob Semple"
Unicom_Socialists.7.c:0 "George Aiken"

Unicom_Socialists.8.t:0 "Lang's Supporters Mobilize"
Unicom_Socialists.8.d:0 "Riding high off his second term as Prime Minister, Jack Lang and his supporters have practically overrun the National Workman's Party. While the moderate faction continues to exist in theory, in truth Lang has stuffed most of the party leadership with his stooges. The Moderates find themselves isolated, and few realize the extent of Lang's ambitions to push his policies.\n\nAfter the announcement that Lang would be re-elected, his supporters took to the streets in droves to pour out their support. Lang himself has instead opted to begin mobilizing his support within the party, claiming that there is now a historic opportunity to achieve a true victory for the American workers. The remaining moderates have a choice to either throw their lot in with Lang and hope for the best, or use their last ounce of power to eject him from power."
Unicom_Socialists.8.a:0 "The Party stands by him"
Unicom_Socialists.8.b:0 "We have to stop this madness!"

Unicom_Socialists.9.t:0 "Lang seeks the support of the Military"
Unicom_Socialists.9.d:0 "Following a narrow vote, Lang was removed as Prime Minister and replaced with moderate candidate Bob Semple. Lang has taken this fact poorly, to say the least, and has taken to rallying his supporters against the new government. The other parties have denounced the so-called coup as undemocratic, claiming Lang's victory in the leadership election should be respected.\n\nLike the Bonus Brigades, Lang's supporters have taken to effectively occupying the American capital to protest and demand that he be returned to office. More concerningly, elements of the royal army have stepped up to declare that they view the intervention of the party moderates to also be undemocratic. If Lang's influence has spread far enough for the military to break their historically apolitical nature, then this could spell doom for the recently appointed Semple ministry."
Unicom_Socialists.9.a:0 "Public pressures Semple into resignation"
Unicom_Socialists.9.b:0 "The military refuses to intervene in politics"

Unicom_Socialists.10.t:0 "The Big Fella"
Unicom_Socialists.10.d:0 "In a fiery speech in Philadelphia, Prime Minister Lang proclaimed his victory over the reactionary moderates of the Workman's Party. Semple has been ousted from power, and Lang was sworn into office to the deafening applause of the American people. Building off this, he has announced that he will be breaking with the Workman's Party and forming the Lang Labour Party, the popularity of the latter leading to the almost instantaneous collapse of the former. Lang's popularity has grown so vast and become so deeply ingrained that few politicians are now able to challenge his authority.\n\nWith the Lang Labour party now monopolizing the political scene and Lang's support having ingrained itself even into the military, the United Commonwealth is now in effect a party state. Lang Labour dominates the polls, and while there remains some organized political resistance, Jack Lang is now indisputably the most powerful man in America, and he now wields the power to keep it that way."

Assets indicate high probability of increased rebel attacks in immediate future. While the liquidation of High Interest Target Sandino proved effective in splintering Sandinista resistance, it has also emboldened other previously marginalized factions.\n\nStephenson's behavior continues to be erratic, and his taste in locals is becoming increasingly problematic. We still aren't able to identify the last one he invited to the presidential villa due to lack of access to local dental records. If we didn't need a useful idiot in charge, I would personally recommend immediate liquidation with extreme prejudice.\n\nThe remaining White Leaguers are little help in anti-insurgency operations. Current reports indicate they've managed to waste thousands of rounds of munitions shooting trees, wildlife, and in several cases their own genitals.\n\nIn short, our resources are limited and enemies growing in number.

Radio contact with the RAMP and troops on the ground is spotty at best.\n\nFurther troop deployments are en route, but are being hampered by escalating protests throughout the city.

Unicom_Revolution.2.d:0 ""Wait, goddamnit, just wait-"\n\nA fist cracked across his face, cutting him off. General Moseley could barely hear himself think over the shouts and cheers of the assembled crowd. Shabbily dressed former soldiers formed a loose circle around the man, firing stolen and improvised rifles into the air. He couldn't see where the rest of the garrison was. Odds were good that they'd cut and run when the anarchists started shooting back.\n\n"Look," he choked out, "we can talk about this."\n\nThe only response was a flurry of curses and spitting. Someone hit him again, harder this time. His ears rang, he tasted blood, cold dirt met his face as he stumbled over himself. He reached into his jacket, frantically grasping for his service pistol. There was only time to fire off a single angry shot before it was knocked from his hand. The shot quieted the crowd, if only for a few seconds, another unseen layer of tension broken.\n\nOne of the rioters fell over, holding his neck as blood spilled out into the dirt. Moseley didn't have time to appreciate his marksmanship.\n\nThe crowd surged, years of trauma and anger spilling out like a burst dam, and the general sat in the epicenter. Moseley clawed, punched, kicked, fighting like a wounded animal as a hundred veterans overtook him.\n\nFifteen minutes later, they strung up his corpse from a streetlight, and turned their rage outward on the city."

Much of parliament has evacuated from the city, leaving only the prime minister and elements of his cabinet behind.\n\nBuzzards have been scrambled to try and evacuate the cabinet by air, but with the rioters moving so quickly there may not be enough time."

He'd thought, at least at the time, that moving to the parliament campus would make for a safer location if things got out of hand. Part of him wanted to chuckle at the mistake, but a larger and louder part wanted to weep. He'd sent Grace to the roof along with the rest of the cabinet, despite her protests. This was his ship, and if anyone was going to go down with it, it may as well be him.\n\nGunshots echoed in the hall outside his office, followed by shouts and screams. Coolidge sighed, glancing back at the pistol on his desk. It would have been easier to end it, rob them off the satisfaction, or go down shooting. He cast those thoughts away, took a deep breath, and waited. If these hooligans wanted to go after the prime minister, they'd get him.\n\nThe uninvited guests didn't make him wait long. The oak door slammed open, fifteen men shoving their way into the modest office. The silence in the room seemed all consuming, all their bluster and confidence sapped away. For what felt like an eternity, they glanced amongst one another, then back to the Prime Minister. Finally, Coolidge's voice broke the silence.\n\n"You boys came here for the Prime Minister, and here I am."\n\nA few glances between the veterans, they shifted around uncomfortably.\n\n"Do what you feel you have to do."\n\nSlowly, almost ashamedly, the men raised their rifles. It was over in an instant, and the Prime Minister fell in a hail of rifle fire. They all knew a line had been crossed, a step had been taken into the deep end. Standing among the embers of the burning parliament building, one of the younger veterans finally spoke."

Due to issues with the production process, however, these replicoids will need to undergo a sort of chemical lobotomy before they can be deployed. Weeks of injections and subliminal broadcasts allow us to atrophy certain parts of the brain, making them suggestible to field commanders without harming motor functions.\n\nThere are, however, a subset of researchers interested in testing the limits of replicoid intelligence. Though not officially supported, some of the researchers wish to see what might happen if a replicoid were allowed to develop without lobotomization. It is theorized that this might allow them to draw on a sort of genetic memory inherited by their original iteration, potentially making them more useful as soldiers in the field.\n\nSuch an endeavor would be ethically questionable, though, and not officially supported by the Commonwealth government."

He tried to recall where he’d been before this moment, but everything was coming up blank, complete and utter void. It was a void of memory that seemed to consume everything in his mind. An unnatural absence of thought that only drew attention to itself by virtue of being an absence.\n\n“Can you remember anything about the accident, how you got here?”\n\nThe doctor’s voice snapped him out of it.

Patterson nursed a headache, holding a bag of ice to his blackened eye. For a month-old clone, Harlan could really throw a punch.\n\n“Sir,” he said “the lobotomized ones we’ve been combat training, they’ll follow their code phrases but they don’t fully understand the commands.

Security thinks he went West, probably towards Melbourne.”\n\nPatterson shrugged, tossing the ice between his hands nervously.\n\n “When we bypassed the lobotomization process, we let them keep some of the genetic memory of the original. It’s hazy, but he might be getting an inkling of who his original was. I think he might try and find him.”\n\n“That might be difficult, Tom.”\n\nA manilla file folder landed in his lap, the words “GENETIC SAMPLE INDEX #501” stamped in red ink across the front.\n\n“How do you figure that?” Patterson muttered as he thumbed through the documents.\n\n“Harlan Johnson’s been dead since last December.

Dawes followed in their footsteps by establishing the Ohio Gas and Coke Company and making a big name for himself during the Great War during the Iberian Campaign. Eventually, Dawes entered politics during a time where the Federal Unionist Party saw serious defeats against the Progress Party. \n\nFrom 1922 till 1929, Dawes made a name for himself inside the party by becoming the minister of parliament for the province of Ohio, beating the local branch of the Progress Party of Ohio for the first time in two decades. During the 1929 nominations for FUP leadership, Dawes was able to beat out John D. Rockefeller by a narrow margin and headed the FUP for an amazing victory in the parliamentary election, allowing the FUP to form a tense coalition with the Progress Party. The unlikely coalition became reality due to the surprising growth of the CCP and Social Credit Party.
