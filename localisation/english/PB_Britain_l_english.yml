This will allow us to reap the reward in lesser quantity then full ownership however also reducing the cost of guarding the canal zone by giving protection of it to the Americans.

Since then the Federation has grown to be the most powerful organisation to ever be seen on the face of this Earth and continues to be the behemoth which all bow down to.\n\nTherefore it's imperative that this system must not change as it has not failed us or the Dominions to this day. Therefore we shall keep the Federation in the same direction we created those many years ago to allow the Federation to progress as it has always done."

Britain no longer sits on the Throne of Imperial power and must relinquish her crown to others. Therefore the Federation shall be a mirror of the Ancient Roman Republic; the Federation's Capital, Government and ultimately the Royal family shall move to elected dominion's over the years in rotating terms. Only the Imperial Parliament will stay in Westminster as a boon to Britain but overall the Federation will be truly decentralised with Dominions only owing allegiance to the Crown not London anymore in an ironic twist of fate."

Africa is filled with riches and minerals which can fund the Empire into a new age of imperial dominance yet they sit there untouched. Our African domain is also one of our largest providing plenty of lands for white settlers which can be a new loyal subject for Britain.

The British African Authority is made up of the balance of power of local treaties and alliances with British rule and any reform which may tread on the toes of these rulers may cause the colony to burn- an outcome which no one desires least all London.

Baring has put forward a proposal in his 'Baring Papers' to carve out new colonial states from the African Authority.\n\nThis however puts forward the plan to ignore local settlers and rulers in favour for more Anglo overlords in West Africa which could lead to potential rebellion from the natives however if accepted the African Authority would split into more stable settler colonies and mining mandates for London- a most favourable proposal."

  PB_ENG_Africa_BAF_African_Autonomy_desc:0 "The Big Six Proposal is the idea of splitting the British African Authority into six states which will please all factions involved. This would see the settler colonies around the lakes become new Dominions in the Empire alongside the international mandate gaining more autonomy. The catch to this however is that instead of creating a new colony from whatever is left from the settler states which would be ruled over by commissioners from London; it is argued that a native ruled Commonwealth is to be formed from the remaining territories to give way to a new enlightened Imperialism.\n\nThis would please many reformists in the Imperial Federation alongside the native Africans who would be guided to create a new society of their own. The snag is that by gifting the Africans their own state and autonomy- it could lead to colonial decline in West Africa and possible independence wars in the Dark Continent; a most unfavourable outcome to London."

Algeria would remain under British rule whilst Libya would be granted to Emir Idris who would swear fealty to the British crown. This would allow us to consolidate our forces in the more precious colony of Algeria instead of spreading colonial forces thin across North Africa.\n\nThe side affect to this would see a powerful Emirate take over Libya who although will be grateful for our benevolence of granting them such a boon, could turn on at the first opportunity they receive which would make the British government look quite the fool."

  britain.1.d:0 "The last days of Britain's King-Emperor were spent in a musty room in Sandringham House, breaking out of consciousness only for the briefest moments to ask about the Empire. Each time the nurses would reassure him, and each time he lapsed back into a daze. Day by day, Edward watched his father fall further and further into the clutches of death. Less than a month ago, he'd approached him to marry, and now he sat at the deathbed of a father who barely even recognized him.\n\nGeorge, for his part, had little to ruminate on but regrets during his brief pangs of awareness. Regrets that he could not be like his father, regrets that he could not be the same great man who had steered his state through the Catastrophe. Had he been more lucid, perhaps he and his son would have that common foundation, but his mind was lost in a morphine induced mist.\n\nThe hour finally came in the dead of night, as George's nurse administered one last dose of sedatives. The sun rose on an Empire without a king and a son without a father. "

However Tunisia is already part of the Imperial Federation under the guise of a collaborator arab monarchy to the crown. If we do decide to send the offer to intergrate Tunisia into direct British rule may prove difficult to the local rulers wishing to keep independent which may cause war.\n\nWe do have the second option however to keep the nation as it is; a puppet to the crown.

However now the British goverment had made good on their promise albeit twenty years down the line by giving Smith and his family alongside other veterans and whites farms in Africa mainly Nigeria to reward them of their service. The natives called it barbaric to boot them off their own land but Ian knew that by actually using the land to good use through his supieror white colonial techniques he would be able to feed the natives who were booted off the lands and maybe even civilise them below the white man of course.

The Colonel was ordered to manage the garrisons and patrol movements near Freetown- an extraordinary boring job which was slowly degrading his martial prowess through the painful years of military bureacracy.\n\nAs he was about to stretch a young soldier-no older then 18, barged into his office screaming that the 'savages have revolted.'\n\nThe old soldier quickly calmed down the boy and laughed confusing the young squadie who was desperately trying to ask for orders.

Of particular concern is the brutality of the attack, with many of those killed having been hacked to death with improvised bladed weapons.\n\nMore problematic is that since these reports were filed, at least four other similar attacks have occurred. Some of the soldiers have cheekily referred to the incidents as the 'Machete Rebellion'. Though it has not reached the point of a full scale uprising, the tension between the locals and the settlers is palpable, even in major cities.

The Danish royal family remains in exile, and there is a concern among the military leadership that the overseas provinces may choose to join the French collaborator regime, potentially giving France greater access to the Atlantic. This is a situation that we cannot allow to happen.\n\nBacked by the Royal Navy, Imperial Marines landed on the shores of the Faroe Islands and Iceland during the night. Caught off guard, the small Danish garrisons, already demoralized by news of Copenhagen's defeat, were quickly disarmed. Though clearly not pleased with the turn of events, there was little that the Danes could do to prevent the occupation. As of this morning, reports indicate that we now have full control over the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland.

In fact, many of Iceland's politicians have been pushing for an open declaration of independence from Denmark. Sveinn Björnsson, a vocal critic of the occupation, declared to crowds in Reykjavík that Iceland would seek full patriation from Denmark. All this talk of independence has begun to make the occupation authorities uneasy. The last thing we need is insurrection on an island as inhospitable as Iceland.\n\nFrom this unease has come a handful of proposals to London on how best to resolve the Icelandic dissent. The most obvious solution is to simply end the occupation, granting Iceland independence in exchange for remaining in the Imperial Powers until the war is finished. A more radical solution, popular among British warhawks, is to pressure the Althing into accepting a constitutional monarchy and commonwealth status under the British Empire. Such a move would be an outrage to the Danes, but as it stands right now they aren't in much of a position to do more than protest. Simply remaining on the island and continuing the occupation would be deeply unpopular with both the Icelandic people and our own, as well as a drain on our resources, but it would ensure we have the most control over Reykjavík's ports."

The Commonwealth of Ireland was originally established to prevent these kinds of uprisings, but it seems Irish rebellion is an inevitable issue regardless. There have been some proposals on how we can resolve the situation.\n\nThe first and most obvious is to simply reinstate the Commonwealth government, albeit with slightly more oversight from the British forces already deployed in the region. The Ulster Free State will be reintegrated into the Irish Commonwealth as well. Alternatively, it has been proposed that Ulster be integrated into the United Kingdom instead. The sectarian conflicts in the region might be better controlled under a direct British administration. The most extreme proposal from the imperial hardliners is for Ireland to be re-annexed into the United Kingdom entirely, a move that would likely inflame Anglo-Irish tensions even further.

The decidedly anarchist direction which Gallacher's cabinet has taken the party has caused the reformist faction, headed by Mosley and Attlee, to become disillusioned with the WUP. They continually fight against the most important reforms of Gallacher's platform, and party infighting makes it difficult to use our parliamentary support to our advantage.\n\nIn light of this, Gallacher has assembled a coalition of the radical party heads from throughout the WUP and proposed an alliance with the United Republican Front. A fringe Jacobin faction, the URF has remained a vocal but largely powerless left wing faction in Britain for some time. Gallacher believes that aligning with the URF and rallying his supporters in the United Trade Unions will give him the political support to oust Mosley and Attlee from their positions of authority in the WUP. The move would be extremely risky, as the reformists make up a not inconsiderable portion of the party leadership.

  britain.2000.d:0 "A curious report has reached the office of Sir John French, Commissioner of the British Expeditionary Force in Palestine. The report, delivered by agents of the Imperial Security Service, contained a series of reports by Jordanian and Palestinian travelers that a white man traveling alone in the Jordanian desert has been spotted on multiple occasions. It went on to indicate a high probability that the man being referred to may be the missing British Colonel Thomas Edward Lawrence, though it cannot confirm this with absolute certainty.\n\nLawrence vanished from his posting in the Trucial States following the end of hostilities in the Great War. The reason for his disappearence is unknown, but colleagues attested to the ISS that his service during the North African campaign and the Arab Peacekeeping operations may have pushed him over the edge. Lawrence's fascination with the Middle East is well known, and ISS agents have been combing the Arab Kingdoms for almost two decades in an effort to locate him. If this lead is to be believed, Lawrence may have been hiding beneath our noses this entire time. Our ISS office in Jerusalem has advised that we dispatch an agent to Jordan to locate this unidentified man post haste, as we may lose our chance to find him with the brewing chaos in the Near East."

Evidence of recent habitation was found, particularly several opened cans of food and a recently snuffed out campfire. Before the agents could investigate further, the cocking of a pistol drew the agents' attention to their flank.\n\nThere, masked in the amber glow of the setting desert sun, stood T.E Lawrence, though at first he was hardly recognizable. Dirty, unshaven and draped in Arab garb, he hardly looked anything like the file photo the agents had been given.\n\n\"I figured you people would come looking for me eventually.\"\n\n\"We're with Imperial Intelligence, we've been asked to bring you in for reassign-\"\n\n\"I'm not going back. Not after what we did.\"\n\nThe agents looked amongst one another, and after a tense silence, the head of the operation spoke, hand lingering near his revolver."

Ozymandias demanded his service once more, to protect his empire one last time before it slipped from his fingers and into the dustbin of history. It didn't matter if it was King Edward or King George, the Emperors were all the same.\n\nStill, in a way he figured he owed his homeland some courtesy for not putting him down like a rabid dog. Sometimes, a hound gone wild still has use left in him for his master. One last ride, he figured, one last ride for the Empire.\n\nOne last ride and he could finally be free, spilling blood just this one time more in exchange for freedom.\n\nThey left the next morning for the border of the mandate, and though Lawrence couldn't shake his pessimism, he did have to admit it would be nice to have a proper bed again."

The French garrison had refused to surrender, and his body shook when he recalled how their commanders had simply shrugged and given the order to open fire. Tens of thousands of tonnes of steel hellfire raining down on a city of nearly a million, and he just sat back and watched, and he swore he would never raise a rifle for the Empire again.\n\nThe agents left silently, riding off home to their masters. Lawrence continued on as though they had never came, pouring over endless tomes of obscure Arabian history. Perhaps, he figured, one day he might make the trip to Mecca once this terrible succession war business blows over.\n\nThe contents of the Lawrence report submitted to the IIS were unremarkable, and few questioned the statements on some Great War fossil lost in his own madness in a savage desert. The report was filed away among the millions of reports in the IIS archives, disappearing into an ocean of bureaucracy, and with it went the last memories of Colonel Lawrence."

As blood pooled around him, his fading vision caught one last glimpse of the setting desert sun, the light reflecting off his own blood as it mixed with the sweeping sand.\n\nColonel Lawrence bled to death an hour later, hogtied on the back of a camel headed back to Palestine. Though the agents tasked with acquiring him received a chewing out, most in the IIS concluded the man was a loose cannon. It wasn't their job to rescue some Great War veteran from his own madness, after all.\n\nColonel Lawrence found his resting place a little over a month later in a Veteran's cemetary in Wales. Though the grave was periodically the host to small gatherings by veterans of the Algiers Campaign, over time the meetings would fade away, along with whatver memory of Colonel Lawrence that might have remained."

Roosevelt, on leave in the isles due to being wounded on the Iberian front, briefly met the princess at a charity event and the two began correspondance. Roosevelt's status as a war hero in the Americas and his family standing among the American aristocracy paved the way for celebrity across the Empire. Both continued their efforts for Veterans charities while corresponding, ultimately leading to their engagement.\n\nThe marriage of the two marks the most official formation of ties between the Americas and Britain, with American and British hardline loyalists lauding the affair as an example of the Anglo-American imperial identity. The King-Emperor has remained largely quiet on the affairs of his sister, and the rest of the Royal Family has given the courtship a bregruding approval."

Despite Edward's hopes, however, the open support of his father continues to elude him and George lapsed back into a malaise almost immediately after the conversation. Though he did not show it, his father's bouts of delusion clearly weighed on Edward, and he quickly left his father's side to announce the engagement.\n\nWhat would have been one of the most important days in his life would, as always, be tempered by his ever elusive father's emotional distance."

Some more radical elements of the government outright denounced the British and have avowed their efforts to take back supposedly rightful Nicaraguan land. Controversy still surrounds the canal even beyond this, as many British reformists argued against the use of poorly paid locals and African \"travel workers\", the latter of which received almost no pay at all save room and provisions.

  britain.4007.d:0 "The United Kingdom has, traditionally, sat as the de-facto head of the British Empire in spite of the propaganda about equality. The last great reform of the Confederation will rectify this issue and dramatically change the aspect of our Empire. Signed into action by the Britain's Ministers of Imperial Parliament, the [GetYear] Act of Commonwealth establishes the United Kingdom as a co-equal partner with the Empire's Commonwealths. No longer acting as superior, the United Kingdom will remain the headquarters of the Imperial Parliament, but will no longer maintain some of their legislative privileges. Among the many policies of the Act include greater autonomy for Scotland and Wales as part of the Commonwealth, though outright independence or Commonwealth status seems unlikely for the forseeable future.\n\nThe sole unifying factor of the Empire will now be the imperial crown, with the King-Emperor and his wife assuming a rotating residency across the various Commonwealths every four years. Under this new system, the British Empire has fully embraced the high ideals of the Imperial Confederation, creating a loosely aligned alliance of nations under the British crown. What the future may hold for this bold experiment remains to be seen, but for now, celebrations go on across the Empire.\n\nThe Sun has set on the moribund Imperial experiment, and tomorrow a new dawn will shine over a people, perhaps disparate, but for the first time in decades united in common cause."

In the long term, it was meant to be dissolved into a series of smaller more managable administrations. In reality, Britain's operations across Africa began to suffer mission creep, as the lofty goal of dissolution gave way to attempting to maintain the peace among the disparate colonies.\n\nWith the potential outbreak of war in Europe on the horizon again, we've been forced to push forward on the dissolution plan. The authority has become unwieldy and, more importantly, increasingly expensive. In the coming months, our officials have announced plans to bring in representatives of both the British, Italian and French administratins, along with representatives from pro-British native officials."

Nigeria would be granted status as a Dominion, with the rest of West Africa organized as British West Africa. Algeria and Libya would be converted into the British Magrheb Territory, with Tunisia remaining a client state of the Empire. Alongside this, the white majority regions of territory outside Carnegia would be established as the British African Settlements Authority under a British Governor General. This would serve to maintain white majority in certain regions of Africa, while also devolving colonial powers."

  britain.4020.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER Representing the New Gold Coast Convention, a series of Ghanian politicians known as the Big Six presented their proposal for a division of the African Authority. Their proposal is radical, and has seen backblash from British Imperial conservatives. The plan would see Africa divided into a series of devolved administrations. Nigeria would become a British Dominion, the Emirate of Cyrenica-Tripolitania would become a client state, and Algeria would become a British Dominion. The most radical part of this proposal is the West African Commonwealth, a superregional government covering Ghana, Burkina Faso, Mali, etc. This would be an experiment in native home rule, with the goal being to eventually transition into a true democratic Commonwealth within the British Empire."

  ENG_Edward_VIII_Desc:0 "His Majesty, King-Emperor Edward VIII has arisen to the crown with the death of his father, King George V. He finds himself reigning over a troubled nation, and an even more troubled empire. Noted for his open distaste for the rising popularity of the Worker's Union party, many leftists now fear that Edward might abandon his political neutrality as King to interfere in politics. Amidst economic and political uncertainty, Edward's rise to power and lack of concern for constitutional processes has done little to ease the government's worries."
  ENG_King_George_Desc:0 "Born George Frederick Ernest Albert in 1865, His Royal Highness King George V, Emperor of India and the British Empire, is in many ways a man that lives within the shadow of his father. Succeeding Edward VII after his death in 1910, George inherited an empire utterly traumatized by the single most horrific conflict in human history. With Europe clutched tight in the grip of economic depression, only economic isolationism could prevent privation, and so George V oversaw the establishment of Britain's diplomatic and economic isolationism from Europe. George V is most known for the catastrophic failure of the Indian Campaign, which saw the warhawk conservative goverment attempt to bolster their popularity with a quick campaign into India, hoping to finally rectify a black stain on British imperial history. George V openly endorsed the campaign and, when British forces were forced to halt due to heavy losses, his credability and the credability of the conservatives was badly damaged. This would ultimately force the conservatives into a coalition government with the Whig party in the subsequent elections. Now, in 1933, George's health has begun to fail him. Frequently ill and delegating affairs to the rest of the Royal family, many fear that George's death is imminent."
