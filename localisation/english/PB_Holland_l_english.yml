PB_HOL_dualistic_system:0 "Dualistic System"
PB_HOL_dualistic_system_desc:0 "The provinces of the Dutch Republic can be roughly categorised into two types.\n\nThe first are the “regenten” provinces, where representatives to the States General are elected by urban noblemen and merchant families. Holland is the most influential among these and is often the deciding say in who becomes State Pensionary.\n\nSecond are the “free” provinces which have public referendums to elect their representatives, although laws within these provinces may differ in who is enfranchised.\nFor most of the republic’s modern history these have been rural regions without an entrenched merchant or landowning class.\nHowever the shocking admission of Flanders as a free province in 1898 permanently upset the balance of power, and ever since the two provincial blocs have been locking horns, both vying to stymie the other’s power and impose their grand visions for the republic."
PB_HOL_republican_agitation_1:0 "Republican Agitation - §Y(Small)§!" 
PB_HOL_republican_agitation_1_desc:0 "With the Great War acting like a wake-up call for many Dutch citizens, the Neo-Republicans have seen their rise in popularity in their endless pursuit of confronting the old regime of Stadtholderate. Many of their members have taken to the streets in protest of the position of Stadtholder and it seems that the time is nigh for political reform in the Dutch Republic..."
PB_HOL_colonial_empire:0 "Nederlandse Koloniale Rijk"
PB_HOL_colonial_empire_desc:0 "The Dutch Colonial Empire has been built piece by piece by the merchants, soldiers and elite of the Dutch Republic. Over the centuries, a large, continental colonial empire has been achieved. Although it suffered losses in the Great War, especially in the East Indian region with the local uprisings, the process of rebuilding and re-consolidating Dutch control has been relatively fast due to the uniquely Dutch way of colonial expansion and administration. Our pearl necklace will continue to shine."
PB_HOL_greenhouse_of_europe:0 "The Greenhouse of Europe"
PB_HOL_greenhouse_of_europe_desc:0 "Our nation is renowned for its expertise in the biological sciences. Developments in genetic engineering have yielded crops that are hardier and more nutritious, while other research projects have opened up new opportunities in medicine, electrotech and human augmentation."
PB_HOL_sapphire_revolution:0 "Echoes Of The Sapphire Revolution"
PB_HOL_sapphire_revolution_desc:0 "When the waves of reformation and revolution swept Europe in the last century we too were not left untouched. Following France’s adoption of liberalism the House of Orange found itself challenged by the radical Patriotten; with them demanding an end to the hereditary statholderate and the return to true republican values.\n\nThe so-called “§RPatriottentijd§!” continued until 1795 when a string of riots and subsequent crackdowns led to their violent seizure of Amsterdam. In a bid for peace the Kingdom of France intervened to save the republic from anarchy, hoping to prevent the ambitions of its own radicals by snuffing out the Dutch Jacobins and instituting the aristocratic “§CSapphire Revolution§!”. Although the statholderate was abolished among these reforms, the dreams of the Patriotten were crushed as the French reinforced the old oligarchy that was hoped to be overturned.\n\nNow over a hundred years later the same calls for change are being echoed by a new generation of radicals. Riots flood the streets as the people grow uncontrollably restless, having grown impatient by our government’s reluctance to democratise. We can only hope to weather the storm at this point."
PB_HOL_colosuss_of_sea:0 "Colossus Of The Sea"
PB_HOL_colosuss_of_sea_desc:0 "While the other nations of Europe dedicated themselves to the Green Sahara Project, we undertook our own. With the new technologies at our disposal Dogger Bank was raised to create the new islands of Nehalennia and Hesus. These islands would quickly develop into modern settlements on par with the British African Settlements, although much less populous."
PB_ORJ_lesotho_resistance:0 "Sesotho Resistance"
PB_ORJ_lesotho_resistance_desc:0 "Ever since we settled in this region the Sesotho peoples have resisted our existence and no agreement has ever been able to be established between us and the Sesotho peoples, thus we are in conflict until one of the two sides is defeated or leaves."
PB_HOL_dualistic_system_2:0 "Dualistic System"
PB_HOL_dualistic_system_2_desc:0 "The provinces of the Dutch Republic can be roughly categorised into two types.\n\nThe first are the “regenten” provinces, where representatives to the States General are elected by urban noblemen and merchant families.
