  AutoCrisis.1.t:0 "Edison Introduces Mining Androids"
  AutoCrisis.1.d:0 "During a telescreen press conference earlier today, a representative of Edison Imperial Electric announced plans for new mining androids to be introduced across the British Isles. These androids, with minimal human involvement, will dramatically improve safety in mines by reducing the potential loss of human life. The droids operate through a series of remote wire networks that allow them to maintain power even deep undeground, dramatically reducing cost and upkeep.\n\nWhile the British Coal and Steel Corporation has not commented on the development, the English and Welsh Coalminers Unions have gone into uproar. They claim that these androids are little more than a cost-cutting retaliation by Edison Electric for last year's general strike. The WUP weighed in on the issue as well, claiming that these sorts of automation changes are increasingly threatening the jobs of the British people."
  AutoCrisis.1.a:0 "Keeping our good British workers safe."

  AutoCrisis.2.t:0 "Edison Electric Layoffs Abound"
  AutoCrisis.2.d:0 "In the week since Edison Electric introduced the new Mining Droids, there's been a rash of layoffs across coal mines across Britain. A large number of mines, bought out by Edison Electric in the last decade, have had nearly two thirds of their workforce laid off.\n\nEdison representatives have stated that the change is due to the reduced need for a large human workforce in mining operations, although the Miners Unions claim the move is yet more retaliation to break the unions. Fights broke out at multiple mines between Edison security and British workers, escalating to a full blown riot at one mine in Wales. Workers subdued guards and proceeded to burn or dismantle the mining droids for several minutes until police intervened."
  AutoCrisis.2.a:0 "Wait, hang on a second-"

  AutoCrisis.3.t:0 "Anti-Automation Riots in Cardiff"
  AutoCrisis.3.d:0 "Anti-Automation Riots have begun to escalate across Wales, with the most intense being in the cities of Cardiff and Swansea. Rioters have been pillaging local shops and destroying any androids they can get their hands on. Even the augmented are under fire, and local constabulary have reported multiple assaults and even the murder of a veteran with an arm replacement.\n\nEmergency personnel in the area are being stretched thin and parliament is demanding we respond to the current circumstances. The local Home Guard garrison is available nearby and ready for deployment, but a military police action could cause more harm than good. Perhaps letting the riots fizzle out is the best option?"
  AutoCrisis.3.a:0 "This is getting out of hand!"
  AutoCrisis.3.b:0 "Deploy the local garrison"

  AutoCrisis.4.t:0 "Cardiff and Swansea in Shambles"
  AutoCrisis.4.d:0 "Due to our refusal to intervene in the ongoing crisis in Wales, Cardiff and Swansea suffered extensive damage. Local constabulary were able to bring the riots to an end, but at considerable cost.\n\nOver a hundred have been left injured, multiple fires have severely damaged the city center, and anti-automation sentiment has exploded across the Isles."
  AutoCrisis.4.a:0 "Perhaps we should have intervened."

  AutoCrisis.5.t:0 "Martial Law in Wales"
  AutoCrisis.5.d:0 "Thanks to the Home Guard intervention in Wales, the rioting in Cardiff and Swansea have been brought under de-facto martial law. Home Guard troops continue to patrol the streets, supplemented by the local constabulary. Hardsuit troopers proved pivotal in pacifying the riots with minimum acceptable losses.\n\nWe face condenmnation from the British left, while the right supports the move. A mixed bag of a situation, and though anti-automation protests continue, Wales is under control for the moment."
  AutoCrisis.5.a:0 "Hooliganism will not be tolerated."
