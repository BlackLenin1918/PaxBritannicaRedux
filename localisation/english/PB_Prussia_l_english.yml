  POLITICS_Philipp_Bouhler_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!03/06/1896\n\n§YPhilipp Bouhler§! nicknamed the counsellor (§ODer Berater§!) has seen Prussia rise from the ashes as a rebirthed nation under Russian influence. A once simple farm boy turned solider during the great war he has seen the world at its quietest and loudest moments, serving in the Russian 3rd cavalry regiment. A regiment compromised of a Prussian majority that would soon turn against their forefathers in the Prussian war for independence during 1921. A war that proved successful in establishing a independent Prussia of sorts, heavily monitored by the Tsar's right hand.\n\nOriginally a fierce supporter of the democratic republic he soon saw through their antics and gained power through a bloody battle in Königsberg that lasted no longer than two days. Russia, meanwhile, looked with great interest towards Bouhler seeing him as a leader who aligned more towards their views and a possible proponent for a more Russian dominated Prussia. Secretly funding him and his Vaterland Front."

  PB_Living_Under_Germanys_Shadow_desc:0 "Prussia has remained for much of it's history as the "little brother" to the once then prestigious Austrian Empire, being seen as the less incapable nation of the two and always being two steps behind in terms of industrial capability and societal development. This has remained true for most of modern history, becoming more apparent with the Empire effectively becoming the European hegemony post Great War. Though Europe is a far different place, the circumstances that allowed the Austrians to grow cannot be replicated in todays climate. Alternative options such as Neo-Imperialism are the only choice if one seeks to expand, an option not open to the United Kingdoms Of Germany."

Though the Germans retain a general majority, the settlement of Russians was commonplace up until the 1920 Nationalist Revolutions in Eastern Europe. Due to this, there is a vocal portion of the population advocating for Prussia's return to the Russian Empire. These Russophile elements of Prussian society, if empowered, would likely see Prussia fully return to Russia's embrace. On the inverse, dealing with them is problematic, as disempowering a Russian minority on the border with Russia would likely be unhealthy for the nation's leadership..."

  PB_PRS_Ethnic_Tensions_desc:0 "Prussia's ethnic situation has been degrading steadily since Independence. While the Russian minority hold considerable power over industry, there is also the issue of the nation's other minority groups, mainly the Poles and Lithuanians. Both of these groups are disproportionately affected by poverty and while the Prussonationalists have attempted to remain pluralistic, there are elements of the nationalist factions that wish to see these minorities Germanized or outright removed. Inversely, the Polish and Lithuanian minorities bleeding in over the porous border often have nationalist or left wing sentiments, leading to the Prussian borderlands becoming a thriving ecosystem of anti-Russian underground groups. This situation must be solved or at least brought under control or it may have dangerous consequences for the Prussian government."
