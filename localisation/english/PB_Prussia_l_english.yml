  PB_PRS_Prussonationalism:0 "Prussonationalism"
  PB_PRS_Prussonationalism_desc:0 "Prussonationalism is a unique form of ultranationalist doctrine birthed in Prussia in the aftermath of the Revolutions of the 1920s. In many ways, it is a synthesis of traditional Prussian martial values with modern far-right economic doctrine. The ideology primarily pushes for extreme ultra-traditionalism and anti-leftism, though conversely retaining a sort of ethnic pluralism to keep the not inconsiderable Polish, Russian and Baltic minorities from revolt."

  PB_PRS_Junker_Reliance:0 "Reliance on the Junkers"
  PB_PRS_Junker_Reliance_desc:0 "Prussia's government is blatantly oligarchic, even at the best of times. Even during the brief period of democracy, the State Diets were forced to make major concessions to the Junkers, Prussia's landed aristocracy. Despite the end of the monarchy, much of the country's agriculture and industry is owned by these aristocratic estates. Exacerbating the issue is that many of the country's major military leaders descend from the Junker elite. Should Bouhler lose the trust of the Junkers, they may attempt to overthrow him."

  PB_PRS_Russian_Minority:0 "Significant Russian Minority"
  PB_PRS_Russian_Minority_desc:0 "Prussia's time as a de-facto part of the Russian Empire has lead to a dramatic shift in the nation's demographics. Though the Germans retain a general majority, the settlement of Russians was commonplace up until the 1920 Nationalist Revolutions in Eastern Europe. Due to this, there is a vocal portion of the population advocating for Prussia's return to the Russian Empire. These Russophile elements of Prussian society, if empowered, would likely see Prussia fully return to Russia's embrace. On the inverse, dealing with them is problematic, as disempowering a Russian minority on the border with Russia would likely be unhealthy for the nation's leadership..."

  PB_PRS_Ethnic_Tensions:0 "Ethnic Tensions"
  PB_PRS_Ethnic_Tensions_desc:0 "Prussia's ethnic situation has been degrading steadily since Independence. While the Russian minority hold considerable power over industry, there is also the issue of the nation's other minority groups, mainly the Poles and Lithuanians. Both of these groups are disproportionately affected by poverty and while the Prussonationalists have attempted to remain pluralistic, there are elements of the nationalist factions that wish to see these minorities Germanized or outright removed. Inversely, the Polish and Lithuanian minorities bleeding in over the porous border often have nationalist or left wing sentiments, leading to the Prussian borderlands becoming a thriving ecosystem of anti-Russian underground groups. This situation must be solved or at least brought under control or it may have dangerous consequences for the Prussian government."
