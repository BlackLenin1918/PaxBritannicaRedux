The history of Russian occupation is one filled with few facts or notable events, seemingly the only thought on every Prussians’ mind was survival against the struggles of everyday life.\n\nThe old conservative leadership of Prussia had allied itself with the Bourbons prior to the outbreak of the First Great War, a decision that would cost the nation it’s very independence with the signing of the Treaty of Tours. It wouldn’t be until Russia’s failure to calm its many non-Russian ethnic groups that Prussia would see itself shortly proclaim its renewed independence under a liberal constitutional-monarchy, this government however was short lived. Bouhler, a mere cavalry officer, would march on Königsberg alongside thousands of disfranchised Prussian veterans of the Great War, leading to the establishment of the Vaterlandsfront and the death of democracy in the nation.\n\nFew know the course Prussia will take in the following months, rumours can be heard that the old aristocratic elements of the Prussian military and government are plotting to overthrow Bouhler and his twisted regime, only time can tell though.\n\nThe §YIndependent State of Prussia§! is an §HEmerging Power§!\n\n§YSpecial thanks to§!:\nBernie, Stallone, Lofn, Two-Watt, Wolfxe, Nilo, Mimi, Globus, Alfred/Fausi, BoringIndividual, Jubs, Tapir, Weis, Erwin, Jackie, Beezlebub, Zerogamer, SilentKing, Soble, Red, and Arj.\n\n"

  POLITICS_Philipp_Bouhler_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!03/06/1896\n\n§YPhilipp Bouhler§! nicknamed the counsellor (§ODer Berater§!) has seen Prussia rise from the ashes as a rebirthed nation under Russian influence. A once simple farm boy turned solider during the great war he has seen the world at its quietest and loudest moments, serving in the Russian 3rd cavalry regiment. A regiment compromised of a Prussian majority that would soon turn against their forefathers in the Prussian war for independence during 1921. A war that proved successful in establishing a independent Prussia of sorts, heavily monitored by the Tsar's right hand.\n\nOriginally a fierce supporter of the democratic republic he soon saw through their antics and gained power through a bloody battle in Königsberg that lasted no longer than two days. Russia, meanwhile, looked with great interest towards Bouhler seeing him as a leader who aligned more towards their views and a possible proponent for a more Russian dominated Prussia. Secretly funding him and his Vaterland Front."
