  ### GENERIC MILITARY DECISIONS ###
  PB_Military_Decisions:0 "Managing the Military"
  PB_Military_Decisions_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the world seemingly continuously shifting towards general war once more, our government should examine policies on our armed forces and see how we can improve them. Many global militaries, despite learning lessons from the Great War, are still in a state of stagnation. The mass adoption of armored Landships is limited, and many a general staff office is filled with men still trapped in 1910. The future of warfare is mechanized, and we must modernize our national military in order to keep up.\n\n§YDecisions made below will contribute to the modernization of the armed forces, represented in the laws tab. Decisions will increase modernization to varying degrees, and upon hitting 100%, you will advance to the next stage of modernization.§!\n\n[get_modernization_level]\n\nOur Current Progress on Military Modernization is §Y[?ROOT.PB_Military_Reform_VAR]%§!\n"

Britain and Russia have already begun plans to launch their own craft to succeed where Epsilon failed.\n\nIf we fail to acquire a hegemony over the heavens, we may face a catastrophic §ROrbital Gap§! with our rival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
