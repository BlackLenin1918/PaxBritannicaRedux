 sp_biochem_moral_dilemma_generic_reward_desc: "The [SpecialProject.GetName] project has come under increased scrutiny and interference from high-ranked figures after one of our scientists revealed that they have moral dillema, causing delays and potentially forcing changes in project leadership. This has enraged [Character.GetName]. We need to deal with these nonsense to keep the project on track"

 sp_biochem_primates_amalgamation_species_choice_reward_desc: "During research on different types of primates, scientists observed that primodiforms based on the genomes of bonobos or chimpanzees would be the most effective. The former exhibit more social and organized traits, while the latter are more aggressive, resilient, and inclined toward combat. This decision will determine the further direction of research on [SpecialProject.GetName]."
