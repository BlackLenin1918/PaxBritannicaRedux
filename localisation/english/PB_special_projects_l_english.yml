 sp_land_jet_trooper_suit: "Jet Trooper Suit"
 sp_land_jet_trooper_suit_desc: "A specialized suit for special forces soldiers, known as jet troopers. The armor, made of an alloy of aluminum, magnesium, and titanium, features an additional inner layer protecting against low temperatures and wind during high-altitude flights, while remaining both lightweight and durable. The helmet is equipped with a built-in target-illuminating module and a transmitter that reads brain waves to control the numerous nozzles distributed across the sleeves and legs of the suit. The primary propulsion system is a powerful jetpack powered by compressed gases, supplemented by traditional fuel."

  ### BIOCHEM PROJECTS ###
##########################  
  sp_biochem_combatagates_development: "Development of Combatagates"
  sp_biochem_combatagates_development_desc: "Initially, amalgamates were designed to accelerate growth and the production of meat and other animal-derived products, with cattle being the primary focus. However, the mutated animals died withing few hours or days. The military, together with bioengineers, saw significant potential in this concept as a relatively easy-to-produce source of cannon fodder in the form of so-called combatagates. These utterly grotesque and godless creations are the result of gene mixing and modification designed to instill a thirst for blood. Thanks to their durability and strength, hordes of these creatures inflict severe damage on enemy infantry, while their appearance and speed have a psychological impact, often causing fear and disgust in people."
  sp_biochem_primates_amalgamation: "Primates Amalgamation"
  sp_biochem_primates_amalgamation_desc: "Years of research into various types of genetics raised many questions, one of which was, 'What if we tampered with the genes of great apes?' Thus, the idea was born to modify and mix the genes and chromosomes of primate species and humans, with a touch of bioengineering. Previously unthinkable, this concept has now become something that could provide an edge on the battlefield. From ethical concerns to fears of a potential revolution, the most determined scientists nonetheless decided to carry out inhumane research and experiments on such 'human-like' creatures, as well as on humans themselves."
  sp_biochem_human_cloning: "Human Cloning"
  sp_biochem_human_cloning_desc: "Cloning, once considered mere fantasy, something impossible, suddenly became the subject of research and experiments that ended in success. From simple multicellular organisms to reptiles, birds, and mammals, the time has now come for humans. A perfect replica, a copy, the impression of looking into a mirror—except the mirror isn’t there. Mass-scale cloning, subjecting the clones to lobotomies, and implanting clear commands into their brains turn these clones into ideal, obedient soldiers who don’t ask questions but act exactly as ordered."
  sp_biochem_materiosynthetics: "Materiosynthetics"
  sp_biochem_materiosynthetics_desc: "A method enabling the creation of crystalline forms of metals by isolating atoms and facilitating their growth around a nucleus. The applications in metallurgy are vast, including the production of metals with minimal effort in specialized chambers, the effortless creation of alloys that are otherwise difficult to obtain, or even the development of entirely new types of materials with a bit of work."
  sp_biochem_chemical_weapons: "Chemical Weapons"
  sp_biochem_chemical_weapons_desc: "Chemical weapons have been used for centuries, initially in primitive forms, but research into more advanced chemical weapons accelerated significantly during the Great War. This morally questionable solution, however, has its proponents and receives funding from both the military and the government. The latest, unprecedentedly advanced research will enable the creation of even more effective, lethal, and efficient chemical compounds that will physically and mentally devastate the enemy on the battlefield."
  sp_biochem_biological_weapons: "Biological Weapons"
  sp_biochem_biological_weapons_desc: "Biological warfare has been known to humanity since the dawn of history, with one of the most infamous cases being the devastation of Europe by the Mongols. They used the corpses of plague-infected individuals to unleash the so-called 'Black Death' upon Europe. In the following centuries, biological weapons were employed numerous times, but they never reached the sophistication seen today. The most highly trained bioengineers can now modify organisms as small as viruses and bacteria to wreak havoc. While humans can influence the behavior of microbes, they will never be able to fully control them. Biological weapons know no sides or borders..."
  sp_biochem_livewire: "Livewire"
  sp_biochem_livewire_desc: "Livewire was created during the mid-phase of the Great War. Its most infamous application was in the 'Iberian Campaign,' where traces of its use are still evident today in the form of Contamination Zones. Livewire is §R*CLASSIFIED*§!. It detects and reacts to the blood of living organisms, functioning on the principle of §R*CLASSIFIED*§!. When activated, Livewire quickly embeds itself into the victim's body, severing nerves, muscles, and veins, immobilizing the unfortunate target. It then wraps itself around its prey, gradually breaking down all organical matter while inflicting unimaginable pain. Throughout most of this process, the victim remains conscious."
