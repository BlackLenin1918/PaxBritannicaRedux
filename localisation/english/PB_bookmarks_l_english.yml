 PAX_BRITANNICA_EUROPE_DESC:0 "The old European order, so carefully maintained by armies of diplomats and politicians, was shattered in 1905 by the Great War. Europe once again became the theater of incredible violence as millions died in the trenches, and in the end all that was truly achieved was the worst economic depression in recent memory and the end of France's continental power. Europe is once again falling into armed camps, all that's needed now is a spark to light the powderkeg."

 PAX_BRITANNICA_AMERICA:0 "The American Peril"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_AMERICA_DESC:0 "Untouched, Uncivilized, and Untamed, North America truly is the last bastion of the New World. The roars of trains fill the air mighty and high and westernization creeps ever slowly to the divided communities of the Great West. The Empire of Mexico and the United Commonwealth will force it, even if mother nature plans on kicking and screaming on her way down. Unless some other unaccounted variable can tip the scales."
 
 
 ENG_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The British Empire, once the undisputed ruler of the world, stands at the weakest point in their long history. The Great War broke the old Concert of Europe, once so dutifully maintained by diplomats and leaders. Britain, caught up in the conflict, sacrificed millions of their soldiers across the French and Iberian fronts. While Europe languished in their postwar depression, Britain retreated into isolationism, relying on an increasingly disfunctional system of imperial trade. With their Imperial Confederation appearing archaic and the Constituent Commonwealths more assertive, Britain faces a myriad of threats with and without."
 FRA_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "Rising from the ashes of their catastrophic defeat in the Great War, France is a nation reborn. The failures of the Bourbon dynasty have paved the way for the rise of ultranationalist fervor. Germany and Britain have suffered weakness and failure, while the peoples of France waited, regaining their strength. Under the guiding hand of Grand Marshall Doriot, France is once again able to stand up to the perfidious Germans and reclaim her rightful place as Europe's dominant power."
 GER_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The United Kingdoms of Germany are in the center of Europe and so influenced by all. With victory in the Great War Germany finally became the second strongest colonial power and had a chance to create great impacts on history such as Britian and Russia. However after the war, failures, mistakes and missed opportunities cost the United Kingdoms great deals of influence and power. Germany is the center point of Europe, enrishing itself in all the different traditions and trends around the world, experiencing another political lockdown and suffering another economic crises. Germany needs to change to have chance of returning to stability ... No ... to survive the impending hell."
