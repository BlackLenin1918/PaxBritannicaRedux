 PAX_BRITANNICA_EUROPE:0 "The Shattered Continent"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_EUROPE_DESC:0 "The old European order, so carefully maintained by armies of diplomats and politicians, was shattered in 1905 by the Great War. Europe once again became the theatre of incredible violence as millions died in the trenches, and in the end, all that was truly achieved was the worst economic depression in recent memory and the end of France's continental power. Europe is once again falling into armed camps; all that's needed now is a spark to light the powder keg.\n\nThe Shattered Continent contains fully playable content for: Imperial Britain, United Kingdoms Of Germany, Republic Of France"
 
 PAX_BRITANNICA_AMERICA:0 "The American Peril"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_AMERICA_DESC:0 "Untouched, uncivilised, and untamed, North America truly is the last bastion of the New World. The roars of trains fill the air mighty and high, and westernisation creeps ever slowly into the divided communities of the Great West. The Empire of Mexico and the United Commonwealth will force it, even if Mother Nature plans on kicking and screaming on her way down. Unless some other unaccounted variable can tip the scales.\n\nThe American Peril contains fully playable content for: United Commonwealth, Second Continental Army and minor content for the Empire of Mexico"
 
 PAX_BRITANNICA_RUSSIA:0 "The Russian Twilight"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_RUSSIA_DESC:0 "The Russian Empire is the largest nation on God's green Earth. Spanning three continents, home to millions of various peoples and faiths, Russia has truly reached the peak of the Victorian epoch alongside their Anglo rivals. Democracy, Empire, and Technology has allowed Russia to compete on the world stage, but some believe these tenets that the nation holds true may also be its downfall; only time will tell.\n\nThe Russian Twilight will contain fully playable content for: Russian Empire, Independent State Of Prussia"
 
 PAX_BRITANNICA_ASIA:0 "The Suffering East"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_ASIA_DESC:0 "The East has for long remained under the subject of European colonial interests. Corporation and state have grown fat off Asia's vast riches, but the tides of change are approaching. A flame of revolution burns bright in Tokyo, China is determined to become the centre of this tormented Earth, and the rest of Asia beckons between giants. Asia and its people will either forge a new legacy or remain slaves to the old.\n\nThe Suffering East will contain fully playable content for: Republic of Japan, Empire of Great Qing, National Revolutionary Alliance" 

 PAX_BRITANNICA_MEDITERRANEAN:0 "The Latin Battlefield"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_MEDITERRANEAN_DESC:0 "The Latin nations of Italy and Spain have a rich history tightly intertwined with the history of Europe. Iberia was the birthplace of colonialism, and Italy remains the cultural pillar of the Latin-speaking world. However, both these landmasses have endured the unfortunate realities of war, strife, revolution, and any other great horror mankind is capable of. But there is hope. Europe is once again going down the path of war, and Iberia and Italy must decide the future legacy of their people.\n\nThe Latin Battlefield will contain fully playable content for: Kingdom of Italy, Holy Order of Spain, Divine Kingdom of Portugal"

 PAX_BRITANNICA_BALKANS:0 "The Greatest Powderkeg"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_BALKANS_DESC:0 "How does one begin to describe the history of the Balkans? War? Art? Culture? Empire? Is it not all these things and more? Whatever the case may be, the Balkans has remained a hotbed of European geopolitical interests. Greece has seemingly carved itself a new empire, inspired by the ideals of both the old and new. Hungary stands alone and surrounded, building itself a revolution against an enemy with no face. Serbia bides its time for the wanting of Balkan domination, a reality that soon may come true.\n\nThe Greatest Powderkeg will contain fully playable content for: Kingdom of Greece, Kingdom Of Greater Serbia, Hungarian Common Republic"

 #Europe
 ENG_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The British Empire, once the undisputed ruler of the world, stands at the weakest point in its long history. The Great War broke the old Concert of Europe, once so dutifully maintained by diplomats and leaders. Britain, caught up in the conflict, sacrificed millions of their soldiers across the French and Iberian fronts. While Europe languished in their post-war depression, Britain retreated into isolationism, relying on an increasingly dysfunctional system of imperial trade. With their Imperial Confederation appearing archaic and the Constituent Commonwealths more assertive, Britain faces a myriad of threats both within and without."
 FRA_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "Rising from the ashes of their catastrophic defeat in the Great War, France is a nation reborn. The failures of the Bourbon dynasty have paved the way for the rise of ultranationalist fervour. Germany and Britain have suffered weakness and failure, while the peoples of France waited, regaining their strength. Under the guiding hand of Grand Marshal Doriot, France is once again able to stand up to the perfidious Germans and reclaim her rightful place as Europe's dominant power."
 GER_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The United Kingdoms of Germany are at the centre of Europe and thus influenced by all. With victory in the Great War, Germany finally became the second strongest colonial power and had a chance to create great impacts on history, such as Britain and Russia. However, after the war, failures, mistakes, and missed opportunities cost the United Kingdoms great deals of influence and power. Germany is the centre point of Europe, enriching itself in all the different traditions and trends around the world, experiencing another political lockdown and suffering another economic crisis. Germany needs to change to have a chance of returning to stability... No... to survive the impending hell."

 #America
 AME_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "America emerged from the Great War as an ascendant power, Commonwealth troops critically serving across multiple fronts. In truth, victory was something of a revelation for the American people, discovering that not only could they fight on an equal playing field as Britain, but even succeed it.\n\nNow the American Peril looms across a divided Empire, threatening to break the uneasy peace in the most critical moment. The Commonwealth will be a global power; the only question now is if that power will be bought in the trenches or imperial parliament."
 SCA_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "VERY IMPORTANT: The Second Continental Army isn't playable at game start. To play them, do the following: *Complete the United Commonwealth Focus: Escalation Dominance*.\n\nBuilt off the back of retired veterans from the Great War under the leadership of Butler, the SCA is a nation ready to do what is needed to ensure a fair and equal America. Every man and woman must ensure the liberation of all American workers. Although our great struggle will test the limits of our dedication towards liberation, we must stay strong, for no one can understand the plight of the American people beyond ourselves."
 MEX_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The Empire of Mexico has, by the grace of God, managed to hold itself together since the days of independence from Spain. Under the Iturbide dynasty, Mexico initially found itself as the uncontested power on the American continent, enjoying a large influx of new migrant workers and a booming economy thanks to the discovery of gold and oil. However, Mexico would soon discover that its believed hegemony over the Americas was little more than a quickly fading dream. Mexico must now face its demons of the past if she wishes to last in this new and ever-changing world."
