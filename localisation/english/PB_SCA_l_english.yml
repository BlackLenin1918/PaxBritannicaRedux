Most of the population consists of hardened Great War veterans and young determined souls wishing to bring about the collapse of the Anglo-American capitalist economic system that had failed them and their families. These soldiers of the revolution have marched as far as Halifax all the way to the Oregon Coast in search for better opportunities, under the leadership of the prestigious American general Smedley Butler. Butler was the de facto leader of the Bonus Brigade, made up of impoverished Great War veterans that felt betrayed by their governments lack of financial and social support. The Bonus Brigade Crisis as it would be come to be known as would see Butler attempt a revolution in Philadelphia with the support of thousands of veterans and general military personal. However, this revolution wouldn’t last long and soon enough Butler and his supporters would find themselves marching through the last bastion of uncolonized America in a bid to escape the United Commonwealth military, finally setting up shop on the Oregon Coast.\n\nThe §YThe Second Continental Army§! is a §RFailed State§!\n\n§YSpecial thanks to§!:\nBernie, Stallone, Lofn, Two-Watt, Wolfxe, Nilo, Mimi, Globus, Alfred/Fausi, BoringIndividual, Jubs, Tapir, Weis, Erwin, Jackie, Beezlebub, Zerogamer, SilentKing, Soble, Red, and Arj.\n\n"

  POLITICS_Smedley_Butler_Exile_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 30/7/1881\n\n§YSmedley Butler§! is failed man with a failed dream. With the defeat of the American-Jacobin Revolution Butler and his disciples marched west into untamed America in hopes of a new life. The result was the death of many and those who were the "lucky" bunch soon found out why the settlers of the old America failed in their ambitions. Whilst their greatest foe is the Commonwealth, second ranks nature and her desire to elevate the human struggle to the rest of the animal kingdom.\n\nNow begins the greatest test of all, to see what it truely takes to break a man, and an idea.\n\n§RSic semper tyrannis§! is a Latin phrase meaning "thus always to tyrants". It suggests that bad outcomes should or eventually will befall tyrants, and that shall be out motto."

It is also no surprise that we also have a relatively large young section of the Continental Army, made up of aspiring revolutionaries and Jacobins. This has caused a bit of a divide between the older moderates and orthodox figures and the younger radicals.\n\nDespite our difference in age, we all have many things in common. We dare to dream and take big steps, taking risks for our beliefs and fighting for our ideas of justice.

  SCA1title:0 "The Dead March West"
  SCA1desc:0 "The roads that many followed laid high in viscous mixtures of blood and dirt with the occasional sight of a corpse becoming the permanent spectacle for the trek. Once dawn came eveyone prepared themselves to once again follow the dirt road left by the failed settlers of the old America. For those who were too weak to continue walking their fate was not so prestigious. They became yet another figure on an already increasing list of "who was dead". It was a blindly sight to see sons beg for their fathers to get up, and the age divide only worsened with much of the old laying claim to heaven, or hell. Amongst the red skies festered disease, rampant starvation, and a total dissaray of society. From three hundred thousand of the intial pilgrims only an estimated one hundred thousand survived. If the commonwealth so wished to chase after us then they would have all the directions needed. It seemed Hansel and Gretel ran out of bread, but not bodies, that they had plenty of. Even when Butler proclaimed our new home all one had to do was turn and look at those damn dirt roads to be reminded of what happened." 
  SCA1opta:0 "Wait let me come too"
  SCA1optb:0 "Good, fuck off"
  
  SCA2title:0 "The First Wave"
  SCA2desc:0 "The convoy reared to a closure, behind followed a huge line of hungry and tired peoples. The food situation had already begun deteriorating at this point and rationing had already taken effect. The streets were battered with sand and the definition of hell seemed all to fitting for the situation at hand. The local militias while not uttering a word of hesitance were all to knowledge about the current circumstances. They remained the only people able to still maintain a full belly, them and the various political leaders. Even the veterans were on the short end of the stick. The new Butlerites began being set new homes and rations and the core population looked towards them with distaste and concern. The worst had just begun. " 
  SCA2opta:0 "Brace Yourselfs"
  
  SCA3title:0 "The Second Wave"
  SCA3desc:0 "As the second wave of Butlerites arrived the crowds that stood waiting at the capitals makeshift gates protested against the entry of more. "What about her, eh?" Shouted a citizen pointing at an old scrunched up figure. At closer inspection of the individual and old crested face revealed itself. "What will she provide now?" Added the engraged citizen as the crowd roared in unison. The old lady coerced with Butler showing to him a small timid boy under her arms. "Now listen hear dear, my son, this boy's father, gave everything to the cause. He died believing in you, in the revolution." Reaching out with her crooked finger she tapped Butlers heart. "If not me surely the boy?" She stood undisturbed at the possibilty of turning back, she knew her time was near but remained defiant at the suggestion of her grandson dying out in these wastes." 
  SCA3opta:0 "We Must Look After The Loyal"
  SCA3optb:0 "Only The Strong Are Allowed"
  
  SCA4title:0 "The Third Wave"
  SCA4desc:0 "Civilians first, the soldiers defend them. That is the role of the armed vanguard, to be the sword of the working class. To aid in the escape, the Fourth Red Army stayed behind to help usher civilians west. The plan could only hold up for so long. Commonwealth forces have intercepted our comrades in Hardin, trapping them between the Illinois and the Mississippi. 25,000 soldiers are now caught in a mouse trap, 25,000 fighters we can’t afford to lose. A relief force could be sent but we are already stretched so thin. One cynical officer suggests sending “the unreliable” troops in reserves instead, but that would certainly be sending these people to their deaths…." 
  SCA4opta:0 "Send Our Most Able Men As A Relief Force"
  SCA4optb:0 "Heroes Are Made Among The Damned, Send The Reserves"
  SCA4optc:0 "There Is Nothing We Can Do, God Help Them"
  
  SCA5title:0 "The Fourth Wave"
  SCA5desc:0 "The third army made camp on the bank of the Missouri, waiting for the river to calm down after a few nights of rain. Nearby, an encampment of Sioux warily watched the Europeans. They slowly warmed up, especially after the soldiers began trading ammunition and other supplies for food. Some started speaking about the cause and are interested in joining the cause." 
  SCA5opta:0 "We’ll Take Anyone Willing To Build A Better Future!"
  SCA5optb:0 "Only Those Who Can Fight!"
  SCA5optc:0 "Thank Them, But We Can’t Take Any More People"  
  
  SCA6title:0 "The Fifth Wave"
  SCA6desc:0 "As the sun set the Northern Army made its move. Consisting mostly of Northerners, Canadians and landless farmers, the caravan used the cover of darkness to get through the cold wet nights. Owing to incapable Navigators, the troops found themselves in the territory of the Confederacy. After some tense initial encounters, the commanding officer explained to tribal elders the situation. Failing to clear the air, the tribal elders sent a messenger, the troops will be allowed passage in return for compensation." 
  SCA6opta:0 "Their Failure Proves We Can’t"
  SCA6optb:0 "We Could Use The Help, Take The Deal"
  
  SCA7title:0 "The Final Wave"
  SCA7desc:0 "The last soldiers have arrived. Beaten down to the last man, the question remains “why?” how could the movement get to this battered level? Food supplies are scarce. A minority are suggesting a purge of the officer corps and of “undesirable elements." 
  SCA7opta:0 "This Long March Has Cost Us Dearly, It’s Time To Purge"
  SCA7optb:0 "No Man left behind! Denounce the Capitalist Roaders!"
