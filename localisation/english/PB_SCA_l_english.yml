Most of the population consists of hardened Great War veterans and young determined souls wishing to bring about the collapse of the Anglo-American capitalist economic system that had failed them and their families. These soldiers of the revolution have marched as far as Halifax all the way to the Oregon Coast in search for better opportunities, under the leadership of the prestigious American general Smedley Butler. Butler was the de facto leader of the Bonus Brigade, made up of impoverished Great War veterans that felt betrayed by their governments lack of financial and social support. The Bonus Brigade Crisis as it would be come to be known as would see Butler attempt a revolution in Philadelphia with the support of thousands of veterans and general military personal. However, this revolution wouldn’t last long and soon enough Butler and his supporters would find themselves marching through the last bastion of uncolonized America in a bid to escape the United Commonwealth military, finally setting up shop on the Oregon Coast.\n\nThe §YThe Second Continental Army§! is a §RFailed State§!\n\n§YSpecial thanks to§!:\nBernie, Stallone, Lofn, Two-Watt, Wolfxe, Nilo, Mimi, Globus, Alfred/Fausi, BoringIndividual, Jubs, Tapir, Weis, Erwin, Jackie, Beezlebub, Zerogamer, SilentKing, Soble, Red, and Arj.\n\n"

With the defeat of the American-Jacobin Revolution Butler and his disciples marched west into untamed America in hopes of a new life. The result was the death of many and those who were the "lucky" bunch soon found out why the settlers of the old America failed in their ambitions. Whilst their greatest foe is the Commonwealth, second ranks nature and her desire to elevate the human struggle to the rest of the animal kingdom.\n\nNow begins the greatest test of all, to see what it truely takes to break a man, and an idea.\n\n§RSic semper tyrannis§! is a Latin phrase meaning "thus always to tyrants". It suggests that bad outcomes should or eventually will befall tyrants, and that shall be out motto."

Butler, a man confined to the limitations of the capability of the human body has in many aspects done what only gods could achieve to do. With nothing but the dirt beneath his feat he has liberated the veterans and workers of the North American continent under one flag and under one people. Now he stands mighty and tall, as the undisputed saviour of the disenfranchised, poor, and needy, he truly is the American Cromwell, and all shall hear his name.\n\n§RSic semper tyrannis§!"

Our continental armies are tired and some rest is needed before the revolution fires up again. This morale pause can be followed up with the furthering of our political goal through a temporary congress, bringing any mind that is available to the centre of our republic and bring a people's answer to how the state must function.

Instead of a dumb, bureaucratic solution that will hinder us in the future, the Congress has put their support behind the presidency, empowering it as the president should be the office that can only represent the people. Without the liberal dreams of division of power, the presidency can formulate the true, uncensored and unsalted opinion of the American people. Butler will be an amazing first President!"

While the President will of course remain an important figure, we cannot allow them to hold too much power. If one man can control the direction of the entire nation, how are we any better than the Tyrant Monarchs of Europe? Congress must be the main centre of government, to be granted the freedom to represent the people fairly and justly.

  SCA_Rapid_Industrialization:0 "Rapid Industrialization"

The industry of the lands we control pales in comparison to those in the west, while we will never be able to match them with the resources we have, we can still wake use of what we've got. We must clear space for more factories to supply arms to our soldiers and goods for our people. The factories that already exist must be expanded and their output increased. If we can manage this, our revolution will have the industrial backing to win. It won't be easy, nor will it be cheap. But it will give us the chance we need to secure victory."

Industrial output has been lagging behind without the proper resources, which most importantly include steel. As long as we lack steel, our arms will suffer in quality and our industry will be unable to properly maintain itself, threatening the very core of the revolution: its workers. Decrees have thus been signed that seek to expand the steel works we own through the purchasing of a handful of new smelters from friendly nations and expand the logistical miracle that keeps the hot metal burning."

Our armies lay scattered, loyal revolutionaries captured and our officials were rendered unable to function. But now that we are out of the immediate sights of the British, our government has earned itself a little breathing room. With this chance to stabilize in hand, we can begin work on centralising our various bureaucracies and agencies. With a tight, controlled and functioning government, we can provide the stability need to forge our path ahead. And in turn, light the spark of revolution."

As we continue to march towards the Atlantic and start to border the fringes of the British Empire, the need to modernise our forces grows. While our militia are rugged and battle-hardened, they lack the professionalism of a modern army. Traits of discipline, cohesion and communication need to be drilled into our men if we want to win this war."

The few which aren't are needlessly bureaucratic and ineffective. Worse still, have have yet to full organise how to decide who will hold these positions. While it's good to have checks to make sure everything works as its supposed to, we must work on reforming and restructuring our various government Ministries. In regard to how to decide who does what, a solution has been made clear. If we make these positions democratic, then we can allow the people to decide who is best for what job.

Though some have called for us to centralise and professionalise our military, we cannot do this. If we allow the power of the military to fall into a handful of people, we risk our revolution being betrayed. No, this will not be an army of soldiers, it will be an army of the people!

The man who tried to lead us to freedom. Though he failed, and the East remains under the yoke of British Dominion, we cannot forget his sacrifices.

But as we begin to restructure ourselves, the question of concealment has come up. Our factories begin to churn out smoke, people walk the streets and our soldiers are bumping into patrols of Commonwealth forces. We must do everything we can to make sure that our positions are not given away. Tightening patrols, establishing curfews and, if we have to, assassinations.

Whatever the result, we must secure the resources that surround us and liberate the people under the thumbs of their warlords.

Wrath can only lead to crime and strife, we must only take up arms against those who would threaten our homes. Envy is the source of discrimination and classist beliefs.

The families of our fair nation should be uniform and balanced. We will create a series of incentive programs to encourage people to form so called 'nuclear families', consisting of just two parents and their children in a single house. A small tight nit family promotes stability and helps to create a safe environment for our children. But of course, no family is perfect, and we must accept that sometimes parents argue and decide to go their seperate ways.

  SCA_The_Gender_Equality_Act_desc:0 "All men are created equal." These were the words our forefathers used, the promises they made to the people of what were then the 13 Colonies. But despite their best of intentions, even this very promise is flawed. For it discounts half the global population, women were created equal too! For decades they were forced to remain at home, serving their husbands with little say in the affairs of the world. Even some of the towns of the West where women have a degree of power, their only oppitunity to get it was through prostitution. We will fix this injustice, from this day forward it will not longer be "all men are created equal", now it shall be this: "All people are created equal!"

  SCA_Gluttony:0 "Gluttony"
  SCA_Gluttony_desc:0 "The Sin of Gluttony is practically the definition of Imperialism. Not just the Empires of Europe gorging themselves on every corner of the Earth, but also the nobles and Imperial royal families taking food and money from those who need it. Practically stuffing themselves on the suffering for others. We cannot allow this tumour to fester within our nation's soul. Everyone will be given what they need, no more no less. No one can be gluttonous if they can only get what they need."

  SCA_The_Fair_Meal_Act:0 "The Fair Meal Act"
  SCA_The_Fair_Meal_Act_desc:0 "Because of the lacking economic power of the state and the chance of crop failure, we have decided to introduce a program similar to the Elizabethan Poor Rate. Meaning that people who may not be able to afford necessities such as food, water and clothing, get it free from the state under the condition that they live in Urban areas or close too it. These actions should ensure that the people are less likely too revolt or protest, as now most of the population should have a stead access to human necessities. Together with this in the program are included, several state funded subsidies for the agricultural sector and for any fishing or meat producing companies."

But more and more people grow lazy, listening to the radio or reading newspapers instead of going outside and exercising. While it is understand to not want to exercise all day every day, we still need a health standard for the entire nation. To this end, we will mandate sports and youth clubs for all men and women of this fair nation. With only those who are physically incapable of doing so being granted an exception."

  SCA_Greed:0 "Greed"
  SCA_Greed_desc:0 "The Sin of Greed, much like Gluttony, is a symptom of Imperialist sentiment. While on a national level, this is a leader's greed for power, land and the forceful admiration of his people, the local level is just as insidious. Hoarding money creates the separation of classes, which creates classism and economic segregation. Greed causes us take from those who need it, we cannot allow this to happen. Everyone will be given what they need in terms of property, remove the landowner class, and make sure everyone can earn what they need. Preventing the hoarding of wealth.

We will prohibit the ownership of firearms for private citizens, and limit the ownership of Cars to what people need. Of course, some items are allowed to be owned private citizens.

A sad truth we will have to address is that as the lives of the formerly oppressed improve, they may grow lazy and complacent on their new found prosperity. Seeking large houses, fast cars and needless expenses rather than truly bettering themselves.

With this Act, we will make it a legal requirement for everyone to seek either further education or employment once they've reached adulthood, with some government aid to help them along this process.

There's nothing wrong with being angry sometimes, it is completely understandable, but it cannot be allowed to tear everything apart. Rather than destroying Wrath like with the other plagues we face, instead it must be filtered and controlled to serve our needs. To be phased out in times of peace and unleashed in times of war."

  SCA_The_Civil_Policing_Act_desc:0 "All across the world, the police force is supposed to be on the right side of the law. Standing as the first and sometimes only line of defence against lawlessness. Despite their noble purpose, it's easy for police to be corrupted by ignorance and Imperialist Rhetoric. We must make sure this cannot and will not happen., Our nations law enforcement will serve to make sure the laws of the state are enforced and nothing less. We will not use it as a force of intimidation or oppression. No one should have to fear a policeman knocking on their door, and with this act no one ever all. They will exist to protect and serve the people!"

  SCA_The_Military_Readiness_Act_desc:0 "While the revolution is being built up, we cannot ignore the fact that the word of Damocles hangs above us. As we gain strength, each day we risk the Commonwealth deciding to strike us down before we have even had a chance to fight. But if they try to attack, we must ensue that they will face unrelenting resistance. But for that to be possible, the people will need more than fanaticism, they will need training. To this end, we will ensure that all men and women of this fair nation must serve in our armed forces for one year, or at least in military industry or other forms of manual labour in the case of conscientious co-operators. So no matter who comes, they will face not just a nation but a people ready for war."

  SCA_Envy_desc:0 "The Sin of Envy has been a constant threat to our efforts to form a fair and equal society. When one man has plenty, while others other nothing, on the bottom will grow jealous of them. While this is the foundation of any revolution, it also creates hatred and injustice. People will grow envious of advantages, both perceived and genuine. We cannot allow this to tear our society apart. We will create a fair and equal society where everyone is create equal. If we are all treated the same, how can we be envious of each other?"

The issue of race has been around since the days of the first colonies in the region, and it will not go away overnight. But we can make a step in the right direction. With the passing of the Non-Discrimination Act, we will make discrimination and segregation based on race a federal crime, punishable by a fine and even jail time depending on the severity of the incident. Now, we're not fools. You cannot erase such bigotry with an edict, and it will take time for this to be fully implemented. But with enough time and hard work, we can heal this centuries old wound."

The Act itself will create a series of funds and agencies dedicated to improving the lives and granting opportunity to those who need it. We will improve funding for schools, build new housing and many many more additions. Once put into the effect, the long process of permanent and peaceful integration will be more than just a dream."

  SCA_Pride_desc:0 "The Sin of Pride, like so many others, is complex in its role within the Human Condition. Everyone feel a level of pride in their lives. This can be pride in their work. Pride in victory. Or even pride in creating a family. It's completely understandable and even healthy to celebrate ones achievements. But we cannot allow egotists to rise and create cults of personality around themselves. Whether political or personal. And pride leads to jealously, allowing for injustice to take root. All peoples will have their achievements celebrated, everyone will get fair rewards. Nipping the problem of bloated egos and jealously in the bud."

  SCA_The_Equal_Rewards_Act_desc:0 "While building houses and factories are good steps toward creating a better nation, they matter little if the people work tirelessly for scraps. Even as we patch the holes left by the Imperialists of the past, many still find themselves only earning enough for a single loath of bread even as they work for many hours. We will ensure this will never happen again. With the passing of this act, wages will be standardised across the board. All workers will receive the same wage equivalent to the amount of work they produce. Those who work in more intensive fields, both physically and mentally, will receive more compensation for their efforts. Thus allowing everyone to earn what they deserve, no more no less."

  SCA_The_Equal_Opportunities_Act:0 "The Equal Opportunities Act"
  SCA_The_Equal_Opportunities_Act_desc:0 " Until recently, in most of the world, education was a rare and expensive luxury that few could afford. But even in this day and age, much of our population remains uneducated beyond the bare minimum. Uneducation breeds ignorance, which leads to prejudice and all the other problems that have plagued us in the past. But education is an effective solution to these woes, and we intend to use it. This Act will create a strong population, smarter than anywhere else. With this vast access to information, we can combat misinformation easily. And create opportunities for success, giving everyone a fair chance to make something of themselves."

With so much room and few local to complain, we can construct vast factories in the Mojave and other such areas.

To gain these men on our side we must begin reaching out to their disaffected young, propagating heroic myths of native rebels and encouraging solidarity with our revolutionary cause.\n\nThen when the time is right, we will wipe the stain of imperialism away together.

We have little in common with the southerners who revere it to this day, but by linking our revolutionary movement to the continuity of these rebellions, we will be able to infiltrate the south’s more anti-British populace.\n\nAcross the Mississippi we will begin smuggling operations and skirmishes with our men disguised as New Dixie militiamen. If we are able to provoke a fight between them and the UC, the southern workers will surely begin to rebel too. Afterwards, we will be able to embrace these wayward rebels as true members of our revolution."

  SCA1title:0 "The Dead March West"
  SCA1desc:0 "The roads that many followed laid high in viscous mixtures of blood and dirt with the occasional sight of a corpse becoming the permanent spectacle for the trek. Once dawn came eveyone prepared themselves to once again follow the dirt road left by the failed settlers of the old America. For those who were too weak to continue walking their fate was not so prestigious. They became yet another figure on an already increasing list of "who was dead". It was a blindly sight to see sons beg for their fathers to get up, and the age divide only worsened with much of the old laying claim to heaven, or hell. Amongst the red skies festered disease, rampant starvation, and a total dissaray of society. From three hundred thousand of the intial pilgrims only an estimated one hundred thousand survived. If the commonwealth so wished to chase after us then they would have all the directions needed. It seemed Hansel and Gretel ran out of bread, but not bodies, that they had plenty of. Even when Butler proclaimed our new home all one had to do was turn and look at those damn dirt roads to be reminded of what happened." 
  SCA1opta:0 "Wait let me come too"
  SCA1optb:0 "Good, fuck off"
  
  SCA2title:0 "The First Wave"
  SCA2desc:0 "The convoy reared to a closure, behind followed a huge line of hungry and tired peoples. The food situation had already begun deteriorating at this point and rationing had already taken effect. The streets were battered with sand and the definition of hell seemed all to fitting for the situation at hand. The local militias while not uttering a word of hesitance were all to knowledge about the current circumstances. They remained the only people able to still maintain a full belly, them and the various political leaders. Even the veterans were on the short end of the stick. The new Butlerites began being set new homes and rations and the core population looked towards them with distaste and concern. The worst had just begun. " 
  SCA2opta:0 "Brace Yourselfs"
  
  SCA3title:0 "The Second Wave"
  SCA3desc:0 "As the second wave of Butlerites arrived the crowds that stood waiting at the capitals makeshift gates protested against the entry of more. "What about her, eh?" Shouted a citizen pointing at an old scrunched up figure. At closer inspection of the individual and old crested face revealed itself. "What will she provide now?" Added the engraged citizen as the crowd roared in unison. The old lady coerced with Butler showing to him a small timid boy under her arms. "Now listen hear dear, my son, this boy's father, gave everything to the cause. He died believing in you, in the revolution." Reaching out with her crooked finger she tapped Butlers heart. "If not me surely the boy?" She stood undisturbed at the possibilty of turning back, she knew her time was near but remained defiant at the suggestion of her grandson dying out in these wastes." 
  SCA3opta:0 "We Must Look After The Loyal"
  SCA3optb:0 "Only The Strong Are Allowed"
  
  SCA4title:0 "The Third Wave"
  SCA4desc:0 "Civilians first, the soldiers defend them. That is the role of the armed vanguard, to be the sword of the working class. To aid in the escape, the Fourth Red Army stayed behind to help usher civilians west. The plan could only hold up for so long. Commonwealth forces have intercepted our comrades in Hardin, trapping them between the Illinois and the Mississippi. 40,000 soldiers are now caught in a mouse trap, 40,000 fighters we can’t afford to lose. A relief force could be sent but we are already stretched so thin. One cynical officer suggests sending “the unreliable” troops in reserves instead, but that would certainly be sending these people to their deaths…." 
  SCA4opta:0 "Send Our Most Able Men As A Relief Force"
  SCA4optb:0 "Heroes Are Made Among The Damned, Send The Reserves"
  SCA4optc:0 "There Is Nothing We Can Do, God Help Them"
  
  SCA5title:0 "The Fourth Wave"
  SCA5desc:0 "The third army made camp on the bank of the Missouri, waiting for the river to calm down after a few nights of rain. Nearby, an encampment of Sioux warily watched the Europeans. They slowly warmed up, especially after the soldiers began trading ammunition and other supplies for food. Some started speaking about the cause and are interested in joining the cause. They have dedicated themselves to the march alongside us revoltionaries, it might be worth integrating them into our society, if one can call it that." 
  SCA5opta:0 "We’ll Take Anyone Willing To Build A Better Future!"
  SCA5optb:0 "Only Those Who Can Fight!"
  SCA5optc:0 "Thank Them, But We Can’t Take Any More People"  
  
  SCA6title:0 "The Fifth Wave"
  SCA6desc:0 "As the sun set the Northern Army made its move. Consisting mostly of Northerners, Borealians and landless farmers, the caravan used the cover of darkness to get through the cold wet nights. Owing to incapable Navigators, the troops found themselves in the territory of the Confederacy. After some tense initial encounters, the commanding officer explained to tribal elders the situation. Failing to clear the air, the tribal elders sent a messenger, the troops will be allowed passage in return for compensation." 
  SCA6opta:0 "Their Failure Proves We Can’t"
  SCA6optb:0 "We Could Use The Help, Take The Deal"
  
  SCA7title:0 "The Final Wave"
  SCA7desc:0 "The last soldiers have arrived. Beaten down to the last man, the question remains “why?” how could the movement get to this battered level? Food supplies are scarce. A minority are suggesting a purge of the officer corps and of “undesirable elements. Someone or something has failed us, and now they must pay the ultimate price."
