  PB_AME_Breadbasket_of_Empire:0 "Breadbasket of the Empire"
  PB_AME_Breadbasket_of_Empire_desc:0 "The Commonwealth is the principle exporter of food for the British Empire, producing everything from grain to tobacco and cotton in quantities that rival even some independent nations."
  PB_AME_Iberian_Legacy:0 "Legacy of the Iberian Campaign"
  PB_AME_Iberian_Legacy_desc:0 "The Commonwealth played a pivotal role in the Iberian Campaign, but payed a dear cost for it. The thousands of dead and wounded remain a black mark on Anglo-American military history, and have lead to a deep resentment of Britain."
  PB_AME_Dixie_Divide:0 "The Dixie Divide"
  PB_AME_Dixie_Divide_desc:0 "In many ways, America remains deeply divided between North and South. The more liberal North, with its’ greater industry, has dominated the South since the Southern Rebellion. With poverty rampant in the South and the increasing social liberalization of the nation, tension in the South has reached a fever pitch."
  PB_AME_Racial_Segregation:0 "Racial Segregation"
  PB_AME_Racial_Segregation_desc:0 "Despite the emancipation of slaves in the 1800s, the Commonwealth still maintains many segregation laws, even in the North. Due to this, the Commonwealth’s Home Army similarly remains segregated, making recruiting difficult."
