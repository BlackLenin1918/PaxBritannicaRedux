  PB_AME_Second_Empire_System:0 "One Empire, Two Systems"
  PB_AME_Second_Empire_System_desc:0 "Legally speaking, the United Commonwealth of America is merely a constituent element of the British Empire. In reality, the United Commonwealth rivals and even exceeds Britain in many regards. This fact was not lost on many, and so over time a policy of coexistence developed between Philadelphia and London. All Commonwealths are equal in the Empire, but America is more equal than others, and we have used this freedom to carve out a splendid little empire within the empire.\n\nFrom the American West Indies to East Africa, from Linconia to Hong Kong, the United Commonwealth has grown from a mere partner state to the dominant economic power in the British Empire. Coexistence is a fickle thing, however, and Britain may do what it feels is necessary to avert the coming American Peril."

  PB_AME_Crittenden_Compromise:0 "The Crittenden Compromise"
  PB_AME_Crittenden_Compromise_desc:0 "Following the end of the Southern Rebellion and the signing of the Calhoun-Melbourne Treaty, the Commonwealth was left with a divided, war-torn and militarily occupied South. The Southern Provinces would remain under de-facto military rule until 1838, whereupon new provincial borders were established under the Lincoln-Crittenden Proposal. This proposal was heavily favored by the Southern politicians allowed to run for office, as it sectioned off areas dominanted by free men of color from predominantly white regions.\n\nPolitically convenient at the time, the Crittenden Compromise severely divided the Southern provinces into what were functionally racial armed camps. Freedmen provinces and white provinces frequently engaged in battle, sometimes politically, sometimes literally for influence over the South. In contemporary times, the situation has lead to a series of conflicting segregation and anti-segregation laws across the country. In some extreme cases, Freedmen who could vote in one neighborhood would be arrested for trying to vote in another across the provincial line.\n\nResolving or even just mitigating the situation is exacerbated by the vigiliant gaze of New Dixie and the Southern Secessionists, just waiting for us to act and incite rebellion."

  PB_AME_Mississippi_Treaties:0 "The Calhoun-Melbourne Treaty"
  PB_AME_Mississippi_Treaties_desc:0 "The Calhoun-Melbourne Treaty officially ended the Southern Rebellion in 1838, allowing the formation of New Dixie and establishing a series of mutual restrictions on both states in an effort to promote peace. The United Commonwealth would not aggressively expand past the Mississippi River, while New Dixie agreed to respect the sovereignty of the Commonwealth's Southern provinces.\n\nWhile the treaty has remained in force since 1838, in reality both sides have actively undermined it since the moment it was signed. The United Commonwealth's filibuster military campaigns in the West still go on, while Ministry One regularly funds Dixie civil rights movements, militant or otherwise. On the inverse, New Dixie quietly funds various white supremacist militias in the Commonwealth, primarily the White League and the Good Ole Boys, the former of which was only sated by their involvement in the Nicaraguan Police Action in 1911.\n\nThis uneasy peace remains, but should it be openly defied, it may lead to a resumption of the Southern War. "
  PB_AME_Mississippi_Treaties_tt:0 "§YUnder the stipulations of the treaties, the United Commonwealth cannot expand across the Mississippi or risk a resumption of hostilities with New Dixie.§!"

  PB_AME_Iberian_Campaign_Legacy:0 "Legacy of the Iberian Campaign"
  PB_AME_Iberian_Campaign_Legacy_desc:0 "The United Commonwealth fought for the first time under their own flag during the Iberian Campaign of the Great War. Though we faced heavy losses, the war brought out a sense of patriotism in America that never quite faded. For the first time, America had stood alone from the British Empire where it mattered, and that romantic notion remains in the cultural zeitgeist.\n\nIn more practical terms, the challenges of the Iberian Campaign forged the Royal American Armed Forces into a modern, innovative military. While the Tommies across the Atlantic might represent Britain's boutique army, America's army is anything but, and it will find any chance it can to prove it."
  PB_AME_Dixie_Divide:0 "The Dixie Divide"
  PB_AME_Dixie_Divide_desc:0 "In many ways, America remains deeply divided between North and South. The more liberal North, with its’ greater industry, has dominated the South since the Southern Rebellion. With poverty rampant in the South and the increasing social liberalization of the nation, tension in the South has reached a fever pitch."
  PB_AME_Racial_Segregation:0 "Racial Segregation"
  PB_AME_Racial_Segregation_desc:0 "Despite the emancipation of slaves in the 1800s, the Commonwealth still maintains many segregation laws, even in the North. Due to this, the Commonwealth’s Home Army similarly remains segregated, making recruiting difficult."
