 gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Landships in World War I were developed separately and simultaneously by the United Kingdom and France as a means to break the deadlock of trench warfare on the Western Front. The name Landship was adopted by the British during the early stages of their development, as a security measure to conceal their purpose. Early landships were armed with machineguns and small cannons, moved slowly, and were armored only enough to stop small arms fire."
