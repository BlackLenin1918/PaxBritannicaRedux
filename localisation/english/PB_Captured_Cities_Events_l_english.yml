PBCity.1.t:0 "THE FALL OF KÖLN"
PBCity.1.d:0 "In a stunning move by the French they have managed to make it to the Rhine river and capture the city of Köln. Never before has the city witnessed such violence and destruction. Now that the gates to western-Germany lay open who knows whether the Germans will be able to withstand them at the Rhine for long.  "
PBCity.1.a:0 "How long will this war last?"
PBCity.1.b:0 "Onwards to Hamburg!"
PBCity.1.c:0 "Defend the Rhine at all costs!"

PBCity.2.t:0 "THE FALL OF MADRID"
PBCity.2.d:0 "For the second time in the history of Spain are American soldiers walking on Madrid soil during war. The city of Madrid, capital of Spain and the heart of Castillian nationalism, has fallen after a long military campaign in Iberia. The fall of Madrid has been celebrated by many across the commonwealth, as everyone remembers the later effects of Spanish capitulation had on the French war effort during the First Great War. The photos and films of the American soldiers that have captured the city have spread like wildfire in both Europe and America."
PBCity.2.a:0 "Interesting"
PBCity.2.b:0 "American power saves the day once again"
PBCity.2.c:0 "We will not let the Americans have their victory!"

PBCity.3.t:0 "THE FALL OF MOSCOW"
PBCity.3.d:0 "After a long and hard campaign, Germany celebrates their recent victory against the Russian Empire at the battle of Moscow. After days of seiging and urban warfare, the city of Moscow has finally fallen into German hands. The Russian army, using a page out of their earlier wars against Napoleon, burned most of the old imperial city to the ground as to ensure a bitter victory for the Germans. \n\nThe German army has already begun to build up the defenses of Moscow as to defend against a Russian counterattack and the logistics of supplying the German armed forces in Moscow."
PBCity.3.a:0 "Napoleon, eat your heart out"
PBCity.3.b:0 "Germany continues to march on"
PBCity.3.c:0 "We'll beat them back!"

PBCity.4.t:0 "THE FALL OF PARIS"
PBCity.4.d:0 "After days of intense fighting, [16.Controller.GetAdjective] troops have broken through French defensive lines into Paris. House-to-house fighting across near-ancient Parisian neighborhoods effectively leveled the city, with French forces staging a last stand against the invaders in the Les Invalides. [16.Controller.GetAdjective] and French engagements continue throughout the darkness of the Catacombs.\n\nAbove, the Eiffel Tower continues to stand like a tombstone over the smoldering ruins of France's once proud capital."
PBCity.4.a:0 "How terrible"
PBCity.4.b:0 "Paris is lost, for now."

PBCity.5.t:0 "THE FALL OF LONDON"
PBCity.5.d:0 "For the first time since the Norman Invasion, foreign troops marched into the British capital of London. [126.Controller.GetAdjective] forces pushed down the Thames, meeting fierce resistance from retreating British forces.\n\n[126.Controller.GetAdjective] commanders announced their victory from a provisional command post established in the newly conquered Buckingham Palace while [126.Controller.GetAdjective] soldiers posed for propaganda photos in front of the partially collapsed Houses of Parliament. The Royal Family has, reportedly, been evacuated to Scotland."
PBCity.5.a:0 "Thus falls the British Empire"
PBCity.5.b:0 "We will never surrender"

PBCity.6.t:0 "THE FALL OF FRANKFURT"
PBCity.6.d:0 "[55.Controller.GetAdjective] forces took Frankfurt this morning, with German forces surrendering to spare the city from a lengthy siege. The city, now firmly under the command of the [55.Controller.GetAdjective] army, could only watch in horror as foreign soldiers marched through the streets.\n\nThe German capital, once host to the German legislature and government, is now merely just another city under [55.Controller.GetAdjective] occupation. The German government, along with the Kaiser, have fled North to a new provisional capital."
PBCity.6.a:0 "Germany's days may be numbered"
PBCity.6.b:0 "No retreat, No surrender."

PBCity.7.t:0 "THE FALL OF TOKYO"
PBCity.7.d:0 "Reports indicate that Tokyo has fallen to assaulting [282.Controller.GetAdjective] forces. Once the shining capital of the Japanese Empire, the city had lived through the bloody days of the Japanese Civil War only to fall to outside invaders.\n\nIn spite of the withdrawal of Japanese forces, the city remains in a state of perpetual conflict as fanatical Japanese apparatchiks resist the [282.Controller.GetAdjective] occupation at all costs. The city remains consumed in a cycle of rabid, horrific violence by both sides."
PBCity.7.a:0 "So much for the revolution"
PBCity.7.b:0 "We will fight to the bloody end."

PBCity.8.t:0 "The Fall of Melbourne"
PBCity.8.d:0 "The major industrial Mid-western city of Melbourne fell to Continental forces today. Frantic reports indicate that despite the fact that many Commonwealth troops fought to the bitter end, the unrelenting waves of our superior armies were simply too much to allow for any centralized defense plan to be put into action. While there are still some Commonwealth soldiers fighting against Continental liberation any hopes of Commonwealth forces retaking the city seem unlikely."
PBCity.8.a:0 "One city at a time boys."

PBCity.9.t:0 "The Fall of Baltimore"
PBCity.9.d:0 "After a long drawn out battle the city of Baltimore has finally fallen under our control. While some may reject Continental authority already efforts are well under way to find these state enemies and ensure that no further destabilizing actions take place whilst we continue our advance eastwards further into Commonwealth territory."
PBCity.9.a:0 "Philly will soon be ours."

PBCity.10.t:0 "The Fall of Philadelphia"
PBCity.10.d:0 "Philadelphia, the capital of the United Commonwealth, has collapsed under its own weight to our armies. In a short ceremony Butler announced to a crowd within the now ruined Parliament building that the fall of the Commonwealth and its crumbling armies was soon to take place and that any who still supported such a regime would swiftly be dealt with. While some in the crowd remained silent or openly protested such a statement many cheered and praised Butler for his heroic accomplishment. Troops paraded around city blocks and just as the crowds grew larger and larger the need to quickly rotate troops back to the front lines would take place. Convoys as far as the eyes could see would be filled to the brim with joyous men who had only the shortest opportunity to engage with friends and family they hadn’t since in years, just to be thrown back into the trucks they happily ran out of in a moments notice."
PBCity.10.a:0 "And they said it couldn't be done."

PBCity.11.t:0 "The Fall of New York"
PBCity.11.d:0 "The city of corruption has been overrun by our unstoppable armies. Few loyalist remain within the city, on a handfull of militia men have barricaded themselves within certain city blocks but efforts are already under way to root out the last of these soldiers. The time will soon come where all Americans will be free from Commonwealth oppression. "
PBCity.11.a:0 "Our struggles are not yet over! Keep pushing and don't turn back."

PBCity.12.t:0 "The Fall of Boston"
PBCity.12.d:0 "The city of Boston has, after many days of ferocious close quarters combat, come under our complete and total control. What remains of the Commonwealth government is yet unknown, but many are confident that the Commonwealth threat has largely been pacified. While there are still some hostile units present within the countryside it is only a matter of days before these enemy divisions kneel to our demands. Vae Victis."
PBCity.12.a:0 "Any day now they will be begging for mercy."

PBCity.13.t:0 "The Tomb of Charlemagne"
PBCity.13.d:0 "Now that the French army has taken back the burial grounds in Aachen of the famed Frankish king; Charlemagne, it is time to move him back to his rightful place in France. His tomb will be moved to Versailles where he belongs!"
PBCity.13.a:0 "Back to his rightful place!"

PBCity.14.t:0 "Recapturing Alsace"
PBCity.14.d:0 "War with Germany has brought the prized province of Alsace-Lorraine back under our control where it should be! Time to kick out the Germans and install our own government there."
PBCity.14.a:0 "A defeating blow to the Germans!"

PBCity.15.t:0 "FALL OF AMSTERDAM"
PBCity.15.d:0 "Not one corner of Europe is safe from the French as they have occupied the Dutch capital of Amsterdam. Although not the administrative capital of the Dutch Republic it was the ceremonial capital and held a massive cultural role in not just the Dutch Republic but the whole of Europe. And as the canal houses of Amsterdam burned, one could only wonder as too where the French war machine would stop. Was it Amsterdam? Was it Frankfurt, London or even Moscow and Tokyo."
PBCity.15.a:0 "The harbour of the Gouden Eeuw has fallen!"
PBCity.15.b:0 "The North Sea will be ours!"

PBCity.16.t:0 "FALL OF MUNICH"
PBCity.16.d:0 "The blood flood is the flood of love,\nThe absolute sacrifice.\nSo, in their sulfur loveliness, in their smiles\nThese mannequins lean tonight\nIn Munich, morgue between Paris and Rome,\nNaked and bald in their furs,\nThe snow drops its pieces of darkness.\nInto which broad toes will go tomorrow.\nOh the domesticity of these windows,\nThe baby lace, the green-leaved confectionery,\nThe thick Germans slumbering in their bottomless Stolz.\nAnd the black phones on hooks\nGlittering; Glittering and digesting\nVoicelessness. The snow has no voice."
PBCity.16.a:0 "The Munich Mannequins, Sylvia Plath"
PBCity.16.b:0 "The Munich Mannequins, Sylvia Plath"
PBCity.16.c:0 "The Munich Mannequins, Sylvia Plath"

PBCity.17.t:0 "FALL OF BERLIN"
PBCity.17.d:0 "Germany stands on its last legs as the heart of the country has been overrun. The city's defenders fought tooth and nail, many refusing to surrender and having to be outright wiped out. But despite this, they were eventually overcome by [64.Controller.GetNameDef]'s military.\nWith the city occupied, most hold little hope for the future of Germany. Berlin being a major hub of industry and culture. With its loss, international observers believe that only a miracle can turn the tide of the front in Germany."
PBCity.17.a:0 "The heart of Germany is no longer German."
PBCity.17.b:0 "The Prussian heartland is ours!"
PBCity.17.c:0 "There goes Berlin..."

PBCity.18.t:0 "FALL OF VIENNA"
PBCity.18.d:0 "Take me to Vienna where the music walks.\nWhere the buildings invite you to sit,\nAnd accompany them for a cup of melange.\nWhere the many palace gardens have jovial pique-niques,\nWith their bikes resting by the trees.\nTake me to Vienna where life ebbs out\nWhere the past lives on,\nAnd composers wave out the windows.\nTake me to Klimt's golden city,\nThe city where even the grey Donau is welcoming.\nTake me to Vienna and don't take me back..."
PBCity.18.a:0 "Take Me to Vienna, İlayda Korkmaz"
PBCity.18.b:0 "Take Me to Vienna, İlayda Korkmaz"
PBCity.18.c:0 "Take Me to Vienna, İlayda Korkmaz"

PBCity.19.d:0 "Despite the sizeable natural fortifications in the form of the Bohemian Massif, the region's largest city, Prague, has fallen to [9.Controller.GetNameDef]'s military. Through defending [9.Owner.GetNameDef] soldiers used the area's geography to their advantage, they were unable to  halt their advance.\nEven with this defeat, the local city's population have begun to set up resistance to their current occupation. In the hope of eventual liberation, but it remains unclear when or if this will be."
PBCity.19.a:0 "Europe's heart beats no more..."
PBCity.19.b:0 "The Czech heartland is ours!"
PBCity.19.c:0 "We never liked the Czechs anyway."

PBCity.20.t:0 "FALL OF HAMBURG"
PBCity.20.d:0 "In Hamburg is the light.Every day the sun will come up to some degree as if it did and didn’t care,\nbut Heinz’s wife knows from the ship’s sirens and Heinz at the front door,\nit is there. Later she will walk by a closed up Russian bookshop, a bit like a bunch of broken rosed from the Volga.\nIn Hamburg is the dark. Every night the day will be freed of rules and regulations and the open spaces will close up to leave room for unbridled whispering alongside the foot-tramp of the solitary,\n while Heinz and his wife buy two bus tickets, a bit like two words trying to find the right poem."
PBCity.20.a:0 "In Hamburg, Terry McDonagh"
PBCity.20.b:0 "In Hamburg, Terry McDonagh"
PBCity.20.c:0 "In Hamburg, Terry McDonagh"

PBCity.21.t:0 "FALL OF ROUEN"
PBCity.21.d:0 "On the banks of the ever-romanticized Seine, lay the city of Rouen. A city engrained in the history of France by being fought over in the Hundred Years' War and being the city where the famed Jeanne d'Arc was burnt. And the today something burns again, the remains of the city and a part of history with it. On [GetDateText] [15.Controller.GetNameDef] occupied the city and surrounding grounds. Perhaps as a nod to William the Conqueror or just simply another victim of war."
PBCity.21.a:0 "A big blow to the French"
PBCity.21.b:0 "A reverse William the Conqueror!"
PBCity.21.c:0 "Don't let them near Paris!"

PBCity.22.t:0 "FALL OF LYON"
PBCity.22.d:0 "Now to be still and rest, while the heart remembers. All that is learned and loved in the days of long past.\n To stoop and warm our hands at the fallen embers, glad to have come to the long ways end at last.\nNow to awake, and feel no regret at waking, knowing the shadowy days are white again.\nNow to fulfil our dreams, in woods and meadows treading the well-loved paths to pause and cry.\nSo, even so I remember it, seeing the shadows weave on the distant hills their tapestry.\nTo work with a song on our lips and the heart of a lover, building a city of peace on the wastes of war."
PBCity.22.a:0 "Now To Be Still and Rest, P. H. B. Lyon"
PBCity.22.b:0 "Now To Be Still and Rest, P. H. B. Lyon"
PBCity.22.c:0 "Now To Be Still and Rest, P. H. B. Lyon"

PBCity.23.t:0 "FALL OF BORDEAUX"
PBCity.23.d:0 "A Roman city in origin it became a cultural centre of the Franks and later France after it was conquered from England during the Hundred Years' War. It is once again a city embroiled in war and was occupied by [19.Controller.GetNameDef] on [GetDateText]. Who knows whether the people of Bordeaux will be spared the horrors of war from here on out or that the city will be continously fought over. Such a wonderful city overlooking the Bay of Biscay may never recover."
PBCity.23.a:0 "Will the French recover from this?"
PBCity.23.b:0 "Gascony is long gone but we are not!"
PBCity.23.c:0 "Not Bordeaux!"

PBCity.24.t:0 "FALL OF MARSEILLE"
PBCity.24.d:0 "Originally a Greek colony it has switched many hands over the course of its long history since around 600 BC. And on [GetDateText] it switched hands again and was occupied by [21.Controller.GetAdjective]. This city has given its name to the French anthem, La Marseillaise, which has been sung since the French revolution, but who knows how long it will be sung at all, for the fall of Marseille is a big political and industrial blow to the French."
PBCity.24.a:0 "Surely this won't go on like this?"
PBCity.24.b:0 "I can smell the legacy of Provence"
PBCity.24.c:0 "Our southern flank is falling!"

PBCity.25.t:0 "FALL OF TOULOUSE"
PBCity.25.d:0 "An important city for the Visigoths, it has always held a special position as a city to pass through when going east to west and north to south or the reverse. It held its defenses against the Muslim caliphates in the middle ages, and yet did not hold against the forces of [31.Controller.GetAdjective]. Which just goes to show that legacy and history do not matter when it comes to modern warfare, each city burns and is bombarded equally bad. No one escapes the long arm of the second Great War."
PBCity.25.a:0 "Will the French recover from this?"
PBCity.25.b:0 "The Pyrenees are close!"
PBCity.25.c:0 "Our southern flank is falling!"

PBCity.26.t:0 "FALL OF NANTES"
PBCity.26.d:0 "Another French city has been overwhelmed by [30.Controller.GetAdjective]. Nantes, a major industrial centre, port and one of the largest cities in France, was a prime target for invasion. While the river Loire did work as a natural fortification for some time, modern military strategies were able to overcome this.\nWithin hours of securing the city [30.Controller.GetAdjective] began to reactivate the factories, ports and shipyards to support their war effort. No doubt to facilitate their continued war effort in the rest of france."
PBCity.26.a:0 "The Loire's mouth has been closed."
PBCity.26.b:0 "Hundred Years' War all over again!"
PBCity.26.c:0 "Our western flank is falling!"

PBCity.27.t:0 "FALL OF BARCELONA"
PBCity.27.d:0 "The heart of Catalonia and Aragon and an important Spanish cultural centre has fallen to [165.Controller.GetNameDef]. On [GetDateText] fell to enemy invaders, and who knows if they will spare the Sagrada Familia. At the end of the day all the war-propaganda, all the screaming and lies and hatred, comes invariably from people who are not fighting."
PBCity.27.a:0 "Com pots deixar que això passi?"
PBCity.27.b:0 "Valencia isn't far now!"
PBCity.27.c:0 "Such embarrassment..."

PBCity.28.t:0 "FALL OF MADRID"
PBCity.28.d:0 "The capital of Spain, Madrid has fallen to [41.Controller.GetNameDef] on [GetDateText]. Oh such tragedy for the Spanish people shall now suffer under occupation by foreign forces once more. The heart of Castile, the heart of Spain and the heart of Iberia. I believe that all Spaniards-even those fighting us—wish that this war could have been settled one way or another by Spaniards alone. We never wanted our country to become a battleground for foreign powers."
PBCity.28.a:0 "Orange blossoms blowing over Castile..."
PBCity.28.b:0 "Spain must fall soon now!"
PBCity.28.c:0 "We cannot lose the rest of Iberia!"

PBCity.29.t:0 "FALL OF SEVILLA"
PBCity.29.d:0 "Sevilla has fallen to [169.Controller.GetAdjective] forces after a lengthy siege. The city escaped the destruction of the Second Spanish Civil War and the Catholic Revolution relatively unscathed, but today its luck finally ran out.\nThe city has suffered extensive damage from the fighting, and pockets of Spanish resistance remain throughout. It will be some time before the [169.Controller.GetAdjective] forces are able to fully occupy the city."
PBCity.29.a:0 "Another Spanish city falls."
PBCity.29.b:0 "What to do with all these Spaniards?"
PBCity.29.c:0 "A blow to the Andalusian front!"

PBCity.30.t:0 "FALL OF LISBON"
PBCity.30.d:0 "Lisbon, once the seat of the Fatimist Revolution that swept Iberia, has fallen. [112.Controller.GetAdjective] forces seized São Bento Palace after a lengthy firefight, during which most of the capital complex was destroyed.\nThe remnants of the Portuguese government have fled the city, vowing to continue the fight from elsewhere. For now, stunned onlookers can only watch in silence as the streets fill with foreign troops. The Fatimist banner, which once promised to bring god's light to the whole world, falls to the dust."
PBCity.30.a:0 "Perhaps they should have prayed for better soldiers."
PBCity.30.b:0 "A blow to the Portuguese"
PBCity.30.c:0 "Not Lisbon!"

PBCity.31.t:0 "FALL OF WARSAW"
PBCity.31.d:0 "The capital of Poland faced yet another invasion and sadly it was unable to stand against the invader. Despite heroic and unrelenting resistance, the weight of arms from [10.Controller.GetAdjective] soldiers have proven themselves against [10.Owner.GetAdjective].\nBut even with the city lost, the spirit of its people has not yet been snuffed out. With whispers of resistance and insurgency already making it through the censorship of occupation. Time will tell if they manage to achieve their own victory."
PBCity.31.a:0 "It is decisive to completely destroy Warsaw"
PBCity.31.b:0 "A blow to the Poles!"
PBCity.31.c:0 "The Polish never helped anyone anyway!"

PBCity.32.t:0 "FALL OF KÖNIGSBERG"
PBCity.32.d:0 "Prussia's very heart has, for the first time in decades, fallen to enemy invasion. While the flat terrain around the city allowed for easy redeployment of troops, the battle for the city itself was hard fought. [763.Owner.GetAdjective]'s forced having made use of the vast network of fortifications in Konigsberg, some of which date back to the 1600s.\nDespite these efforts, the city's garrison has either surrendered or been wiped out. With [763.Controller.GetAdjective] quick to seize control of the city's ports and naval facilities to facilitate Baltic operations."
PBCity.32.a:0 "Fredrick the Great spins in his grave."

PBCity.32.c:0 "Useless bunch, those Prussians!"

PBCity.33.t:0 "FALL OF KRAKOW"
PBCity.33.d:0 "Poland's heart and soul have been turned into a warzone by [88.Controller.GetAdjective]. A major city in Galicia home to a sizeable Polish population, Kraków's defenders were finally overwhelmed. With the last organized military resistance falling after several days of fighting. The last of its defenders holding out in Wawel Castle.\nWhile not the official Polish capital, many Poles have considered Krakow to be their cultural capital.

PBCity.34.t:0 "FALL OF RIGA"

Riga, the largest city in Latvia, was not able to fend off the invasion desptie serious reinforcement and increased fortifications. Both along the coast and within Riga itself. The assault began with heavy costal bombardments from [12.Controller.GetNameDef]'s naval forces. Followed by marine landings and a conventional assault. With the major ports and shipyards secured, [12.Controller.GetNameDef] is one step closer to total control over the Baltic sea."
PBCity.34.a:0 "Krakow the city of Kings, was no longer mine"
PBCity.34.b:0 "Galicia will soon fall!"

PBCity.35.t:0 "FALL OF MINSK"

PBCity.36.t:0 "FALL OF KIEV"
PBCity.36.d:0 "Considered one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, Kiev has once again been turned into a smoking ruin by foreign invaders. Despite a valiant resistance by [202.Owner.GetAdjective] forces within the city.\nThe loss of Kiev has now only deprived [202.Owner.GetNameDef] of a major industrial centre, but has also allowed [202.Controller.GetNameDef] easy access to river crossings over the Dnipro River.

The city was surrounded by [195.Controller.GetNameDef]'s forces, cutting off lines of resupply and retreat. After a gruelling siege, the city's civilian and military authorities have surrendered.

But today it is remembered only as a bloody battle in the war between [217.Controller.GetNameDef] and [217.Owner.GetNameDef].\nThe city's defenders fought street by street, building by building, room by room. But these efforts, though valiant, were only able to slow the advance of the [insert invader]'s military. With the city secure, access to the resources in the Caucuses is likely to follow suit. "

PBCity.38.c:0 "The road to the Urals lays open!"

[2.Controller.GetAdjective] troops entered the city on [GetDateText] following gruesome amounts of bloodshed.\nThough the city is not the administrative capital of Italy, it is certainly the cultural capital, given its storied history and status as the place where western civilization’s foundations were built.

[137.Controller.GetAdjective] forces have managed to overrun its garrison, despite the valiant efforts of its defenders and the usage of its costal batteries.\nA major Black Sea naval port boasting impressive coastal defences, an assault on the city was widely considered inevitable in order to secure Ukraine.
