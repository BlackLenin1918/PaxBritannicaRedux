  PB_MEX_Vestigial_Empire_desc:0 "Mexico once spanned from the arid deserts of the Mojave to the sweltering jungles of Centroamerica, but that was a long time ago. A century of economic decline, political infighting and ethnic separatism have shredded the Mexican Empire down to a nub. Mexico has become the Sick Man of the Americas, with an economy in freefall and political radicalization growing day by day. The military-led sham democracy is proving increasingly incapable of controlling public unrest, and the danger of civil war seems more real every day."
  PB_MEX_Suspended_Constitution:0 "Suspended Constitution"
  PB_MEX_Suspended_Constitution_desc:0 "The Mexican Constitution was suspended following the election of the socialist Popular Front in 1928. A committee of military, business, and intelligentsia interests have governed the country without a constitution ever since. Despite their best efforts, political unrest has never quite ended, and the harsh hand of the military has only been stayed by cooler heads. Pressure from the Emperor has pushed the junta to allow for controlled elections in 1933 in the hope that the veneer of democracy will quell public anger."
  PB_MEX_Revolutionary_Legacy:0 "Legacy of 1878"
  PB_MEX_Revolutionary_Legacy_desc:0 "The Great Northern Revolution, known in Mexico proper as the Great Northern Rebellion, was the collapse of Mexico City's authority in their Northern provinces. The catastrophic defeat of Imperial forces lead to the secession of Tejas, Santa Fe, Rio Grande, Yucatan and California, and destroyed Mexico's repuation as a regional power. Even decades later, the wounds of the 1878 Revolutions are still raw for the Empire, and the reactionary government response drove much of Mexico's scientific and educational talent North to greener pastures."

  mexico.1.t:0 "The Guadalajura Raid"
  mexico.1.d:0 "Very early this morning, a group of criminals broke into the vault of the national bank in Guadalajara. The robbers used the sewer system to get underneath the vault and drill up. When the police arrived in the sewer tunnel, it seemed they’d been working on this for a while as many items could be found down there to indicate that, such as mattresses, food, a couch among other things. \n\After some calculations and administration, it has been calculated that about a hundred thousand pesos has been stolen from the bank. They stayed unnoticed because outside, presumably some friends of the robbers, had caused a scene outside by playing some music and starting some festivities, which took most of the local authorities attention. It is also not known yet whether any of the bank employees were bribed or in on it in any way yet, tomorrow an investigation will be started by the Guadalajara police with aid from the government."
  mexico.1.a:0 "Those scum wil pay!"
  
  mexico.2.t:0 "Yucatan Border Skirmish"
  mexico.2.d:0 "This afternoon a small fire fight broke out between the Yucatani and Mexican border garrison. Sources believe it broke out because one of the Yucatan soldiers stepped on Mexican soil, which has been illegal since a year after their secession from Mexico. The border between our two countries has been closed since that secession, nor is trade allowed. But because of frequent smuggling, refugees and various other reasons, both our countries have agreed to uphold a permanent border garrison on both sides of said border. Although there are diplomatic relations between Yucatan and Mexico, in case of incidents like these, these relations can get heated and create tension in the area between the two armies who are stationed there. Thus far luckily both sides have stayed calm and decided to come to a conclusion together and figure anything out if needed. No one died in the incident and one person was shot in the arm during the fire fight, but he did not have to go to the hospital."
  mexico.2.a:0 "What do they want now?"
  
  mexico.3.t:0 "Uruapan Railway Strike"
  mexico.3.d:0 "Due to heavy rainfall, worthless wages and general spite for their jobs and bosses, railway construction workers decided to go on strike and incite a small revolt just after their lunch breaks. At that time in the day about 9 millimetres of rain had fallen, making it almost impossible to properly construct the railway, but the boss decided it was fine and told them to keep working. They didn’t and started protesting, it was pretty peaceful to begin with until one member broke mentally and punched one of the higher ups who were present. At that moment all hell broke loose. Some of the higher ups started shooting at the dozens of railway workers. This chaos continued till 10 of the workers were either shot or hit in the head with a tool. Despite all this, the railway workers returned later that day to fulfil their quota. Still utterly wet."
  mexico.3.a:0 "That'll teach em!"
  
  mexico.4.t:0 "Como Una Piedra Rodante"
  mexico.4.d:0 "Como Una Piedra Rodante, a new book freshly released by Dylan Villacrés. It almost immediately became a bestseller, and is widely available in most book shops across the country. Although the true meaning of the book is unknown, the story is about a girl who was born into a rich family who loses all their wealth, and by the age of 20 the girl lives on the street like a hobo. Many things happen to her while out there. She is raped by several men, some of which she knew before the collapse of her familys wealth. She also tries to apply for several jobs, but is refused because of her state of life and lack of skills. It is a bumpy ride for the girl, who is clueless of the true meaning of life and death. Nor does she know what happened to her family. She is invisible to the world. It is also unknown whether the story takes place in Mexico and is supposed to reflect upon the country’s current state. A truly compelling story with many twists and turns, perfect for the average reader."
  mexico.4.a:0 "How intriguing!"
  
  mexico.5.t:0 "Ecuadorian Refugees"
  mexico.5.d:0 "With the current ongoing conflict between the Ecuadorian Revolutionaries and the Gran Colombian government many people have decided to flee the country. Some have fled to the Galapagos islands, others have spread out amongst South American countries. Many went to Peru, the Acre Republic and Brazil. But in this case about 150 people together bought a boat and made their way north, hoping to avoid the Gran Colombian pacific fleet. After being successful in doing so they went through a major storm which everyone survived. After 5 days of sea travel they landed on our pacific coast. Where they were welcomed by the locals. The officials there were informed of their arrival and eventually the central government, who decided to officially give asylum to them and any future Ecuadorian refugee who should flee during the war."
  mexico.5.a:0 "All Are Welcome!"
  
  mexico.6.t:0 "Zacatecas Water Crisis"
  mexico.6.d:0 "Near the north of the country, there is a desert region called Zacatecas. Recently because of the extreme Mexican summer heat, wells all throughout the reason have dried up. Many people are fearing a water famine might occur in the region. Already we’re seeing significant negative impact on the area and population because of the drought. A few older people have even died because of dehydration. Plus this will likely lead to a crop failure later down in the year. Though the government hasn’t issued an official response to the matter, it is expected that they will assist the people there within a week or so."
  mexico.6.a:0 "We must help those people!"

  mexico.7.t:0 "New Military Academy"
  mexico.7.d:0 "After much delay, budget cuts and protest by the locals the Toluca Military Academy has finally been built and has gone into use immediately. Many of the locals objected to the construction of the academy, but many people also greatly welcomed the academy. They believe it will bring more prosperity to the region as new soldiers have to spend their days here training. Especially local police chief Mario Murillo was enthusiastic about the coming of the academy as he believes the greatest thing to do is to serve in the army. Head of the Academy is Captain Juan Tassis, a strict and disciplined army veteran who wants to prepare the next generation for the next war."
  mexico.7.a:0 "Good For The Young Folk!"

  mexico.8.t:0 "Jacobin Assasinated"
  mexico.8.d:0 "Much uproar in the port city of Puerto Vallarta today. Because last night influential Jacobin politician Daniel Pardo was assassinated in a bar after getting drunk and getting into a heated argument with some conservative gentlemen about the California Republic. Daniel Pardo believed Mexico and California should unify under the control of Zapatista peacefully. Which the also drunk conservatives highly disagreed with and argued instead that the two nations should go to war once more and unify under the stronger rule of Mexico. After a small brawl one of the gentlemen shot the Jacobin and fled the scene.\n\The killer has not been caught but the police have talked to some of his friends who were there when the murder occured.Daniel Pardo will be buried in his family’s grave in his home town of Colima."
  mexico.8.a:0 "A Blow To The Jacobins!"

  mexico.9.t:0 "The December Reforms"
  mexico.9.d:0 "Now with the harsh summer and rainy fall behind us, we head swiftly into the winter. During which the government has announced several reforms, dubbed the December Reforms.\n\They will be aimed at stopping corruption on the local level by having a different government official every 2 months, which is to stop bribing, check the finances and policies of the local government, and when there is anything off it will be shown to the central government who will investigate the matter. Also in the reforms are included a prolonged police academy program. First to become a police officer you would have to be in the academy for 3 years, this has now been upped to 5 years. Together with this comes a renewed fight against bandits in the countryside who oppress many innocent people yearly. Many say this is the beginning of what good is to come for the people of Mexico. Not everyone is onboard, but virtually everyone is happy that at least something is being done."
  mexico.9.a:0 "Finally Some Good News!"

  #1934
  mexico.10.t:0 "Introduction Of Prohibition"
  mexico.10.d:0 "Although the December reforms have done a great deal for the people and for the country, the government has noted that during that same December period there is something else they would have liked to have tackled.\n\ They wish to limit the use of alcohol, as many studies and eye witness accounts have noted that it leads to more domestic abuse and of more arrests of young people, who then get a criminal record and may be unable to get a job.\n\Thus the government has chosen to put a ban on the sale or production of liquor, beer and other sorts of alcoholic drink anywhere. Although it is not illegal to drink or own it, it is now illegal to buy it. And if the police find out someone is selling or buying anything, they will fine those people heavily.\n\Some of the more reformist groups find this change to be good and will mean that the Mexican people are no longer distracted by such useless matters as alcohol. On the other hand, the public isn’t so keen on the idea. They do agree that the things mentioned above are indeed issues needing to be dealt with, but maybe not this way."
  mexico.10.a:0 "It May Help!"

  mexico.11.t:0 "The Alcohol Riots"
  mexico.11.d:0 "With the recent introduction of the Prohibition Law, many pub, cafe and alcoholic drink factory owners have begun to riot. They are rioting because the law has virtually bankrupted them as for most of them, alcohol sale was the primary source of income. Now that they can’t sell it, their businesses are either useless or making such less income they are unable to pay rent or the owner unable to pay workers or for his own food. Their demands are simple, prohibition must go. But the government won’t submit, and instead offered concessions and subsidies to the protestors. But this won’t be enough. I guess we’ll have to see where this goes."
  mexico.11.a:0 "Maybe It Wasn't Such A Good Idea?"

  mexico.12.t:0 "The Booze Killer"
  mexico.12.d:0 "Darkness looms in the streets of Mexico City. Police have dubbed him ‘The Booze Killer’. A few people have been arrested, but none have been the killer, as the murdering spree kept going after the arrests. The unsuccessful capture of the killer has caused several police officers to be fired.\n\He or she is called ‘The Booze Killer’ because its motive for killing is apparently prohibition. It kills people not obeying the law. When it sees someone on the street drunk, with alcohol in their possession or both, it decides to wait not for god, but do the job himself. The identity of the killer is completely unknown to anyone, nor is it known whether it is the same person or a group of people and many wonder if it is even human."
  mexico.12.a:0 "Who Could This Be?"

  mexico.13.t:0 "Increased Mafia Activity"
  mexico.13.d:0 "Police arrests are ramping up throughout the whole country these last few months. Mostly having to do with the illegal sale or production of beer and alcoholic drinks. It mostly seemed harmless till a certain point, which is when the police arrested a well known and wanted mafia boss. He was captured, alongside some workers, in what was assumed to be an abandoned mine producing illegal beer.\n\After his capture the police began to wonder whether any of the other big mafia families in Mexico might be involved in this whole alcohol cartel. Their suspicions were confirmed when the arrests started piling up again, which again included various members of various mafia families. With this revelation, the government has become rather worried about the safety of the citizens and the stability of the nation. They’re unsure of what their next plan of action should be."
  mexico.13.a:0 "Things Are Heating Up!"

  mexico.14.t:0 "Government Rumours"
  mexico.14.d:0 "Many rumours have been going around between government officials about the prohibition law. Some have been about whether it was even a good idea, some about the recent mafia activity surrounding the law, but most are speaking of a possible reform or abolition of the law. But sadly nothing has been confirmed and protests are still ongoing in the streets of multiple Mexican cities. What will be done?"
  mexico.14.a:0 "What Will Happen Next?"

  mexico.15.t:0 "Prohibition Reforms"
  mexico.15.d:0 "The decision is final. Prohibition shall be reformed, not abolished, reformed. And it seems it will be done in a way to make most people happy. The changes are clear. The sale of alcoholic drinks is technically still illegal, but can now be bought in government owned stores. The beer production companies are allowed to produce it again if they get a deal with the government. Prices will also be set by the government on a national level. There is also good news for the cafe and pub owners, they can sell alcohol with the permission of the local government alcohol store, which will be where they get their alcohol for a lower price, after which they can sell it again for the national price. They are also only allowed to sell it from 19:00 in the evening to 3:00 in the night.\n\Basically everyone is happy with this change, because it ensures that people can still drink their favourite beer, reduce mafia activity and still cut down on alcohol use and abuse. A real step in the right direction many have said."
  mexico.15.a:0 "Let's Hope It'll Work!"

  mexico.16.t:0 "Heat Wave Of '34"
  mexico.16.d:0 "Many people this summer found themselves essentially drying up. There was a massive crop failure in the entire north of the country thus resulting in a semi-famine in the north until they were resupplied by farms from the south. It was a critical situation for anyone to be in. Many people temporarily or permanently moved to live with family in the south. But even there at times the heat was unbearable.\n\All this heat caused some political instability in the central government, who were ineffective in dealing with the semi-famine and water problems in the north country. This meant that many people had to suffer because of incompetent bureacracy. This is certainly not a good image for the government."
  mexico.16.a:0 "Damn It's Hot!"

  mexico.17.t:0 "Durango Water Company"
  mexico.17.d:0 "After the terrible catastrophe that was the summer, the government has decided to take major measures to ensure it can never happen again. They have launched the Durango Water Company, a semi-independent company funded by the government.\n\This company has practically all the rights to water in Mexico, and is allowed to build filtration stations, canals to redirect water currents and pipelines to supply people in other areas. And when something like the heat wave should occur again, this company will make the decisions on how to deal with it effectively without having to wait for orders from the tops of the national government. Some people are worried about the power this company will gain over the water supply, but the government said not to worry as they will keep a very close eye on anything this company does, plus the fact that for large scale projects they’ll need government permits and funds, which they can’t gain without the government looking into the project. This does spark some hope."
  mexico.17.a:0 "I Was A Bit Thirsty This Summer!"

  mexico.18.t:0 "Corruption Investigation"
  mexico.18.d:0 "Although the December Reforms had been relatively successful at eliminating corruption at the smaller scale across the country, corruption on the higher levels was never addressed. Until now. Recently a worker from the ministry of finance had been accused of taking bribes from the mafia in Mexico City and leaking certain classified documents to them. When the higher ups heard of this news, they were furious. Next week he is being tried in the court of Mexico City. Everyone knew there was corruption, but didn’t think it was this bad."
  mexico.18.a:0 "What A Scandal!"
  
  #1935
  mexico.19.t:0 "The War On The Mafia"
  mexico.19.d:0 "It is official. The government is fed up. In a message in the press the government stated that the mafia has crossed the final line. They have now officially declared war on the mafia. Meaning that they will do everything in their power to fight these drunk scum, backwards terrorists and corrupt monsters. Included with the declaration of war was a renewed budget for the police, army and border garrisons. From now on every person crossing any border will be checked, no more loose ends. The police will also more easily be able to intrude on people’s privacy and private property. This was slightly worrying to the population, who haven’t been calmed yet. The government is hoping that with the combination of all these measures that eventually some time soon, Mexico will be beridden of these horrors."
  mexico.19.a:0 "Sons Of Bitches!"

  mexico.20.t:0 "La Banda De Neptuno"
  mexico.20.d:0 "Drugs, booze and psychedelic moods. La Banda Di Neptuno has it all. La Banda Di Neptuno or The Band From Neptune, is an up and coming Mexican band who mostly play in clubs or festivals. They are all the rage with the kids, who think the band's music makes them feel free and makes them think about themselves and life more thoroughly. This new found freedom has inspired many teens to start writing their own lyrics or create their own music. They are also liked very much for their deep meaning lyrics, though most of the older folk will blame this on the drugs. The psychedelia and avant-garde feels of the band have attracted many people to go to their concerts and buy their records. They have announced a tour of all of Mexico, and are happy with all the attention. The band has also stated that with the newfound funds they want to innovate even more on future records. Some say this is the beginning of a new era for music and others are more sceptical. Whatever you might think about them, they are staying."
  mexico.20.a:0 "Nice Tunes!"

  mexico.21.t:0 "Villa De Cristal Raid"
  mexico.21.d:0 "It was a cold night, about 3 degrees celsius. Wasn’t much going on around here. The lights were out at Villa De Cristal. They had no idea what was coming.\n\‘Are you ready to move in Squad 1? Over’\n\’We are ready to move in Commander. Over’\n\’Good Squad 1, move in on my command. Over’\n\’Alright, move in Squad 1!’\n\The doors busted open with a loud bang as the troops of squad 1 moved in to secure the villa. The gangsters, overwhelmed by the troops either took cover, were shot or started shooting back. It was a real shooting fest.\n\Then everything calmed down. Was everyone dead? No, quite the contrary. It seems squad 1 had come out victorious, with only losing 1 troop.\n\They quickly arrested any remaining gangsters and started to secure the rest of the villa. The rooms were either empty or ravaged with bullets. That was until they made it to the garage. Cocaine, cocaine everywhere. Must have been about 500 kilos of pure cocaine. All neatly packed and ready for shipping. A victory for the government."

His odd clothing was described as modern or new, looked out of place and kind of like something the British would make. And he seemed to be carrying some sort of small box with colours on it. Appeared outta nowhere in the middle of Tucson a few days ago. He went to a bar and asked for a man named Juba. No one knew who the man was looking for exactly. After asking why the man needed to see this ‘Juba’, the man answered by showing a letter he got from Juba. Showing a date and time which happened to be today on that day. Nuthin unusual till you notice that with the date included is a year, which would surely be unnecessary for any normal letter. The man disappeared after that, causing a bit of trouble when he tried to cook some meat in his hotel room and burned the carpet. He fled quickly from the scene. The police are still clueless about the man's whereabouts and identity, all we have to go off is a small note that fell out of his pocket which said the words ‘stin bode chkpon’, with a bunch of white bits between the letter. Nobody knows what it means."
