  PB_MEX_Vestigial_Empire:0 "Vestigial Empire"
  PB_MEX_Vestigial_Empire_desc:0 "Mexico once spanned from the arid deserts of the Mojave to the sweltering jungles of Centroamerica, but that was a long time ago. A century of economic decline, political infighting and ethnic separatism have shredded the Mexican Empire down to a nub. Mexico has become the Sick Man of the Americas, with an economy in freefall and political radicalization growing day by day. The military-led sham democracy is proving increasingly incapable of controlling public unrest, and the danger of civil war seems more real every day."
  PB_MEX_Suspended_Constitution:0 "Suspended Constitution"
  PB_MEX_Suspended_Constitution_desc:0 "The Mexican Constitution was suspended following the election of the socialist Popular Front in 1928. A committee of military, business, and intelligentsia interests have governed the country without a constitution ever since. Despite their best efforts, political unrest has never quite ended, and the harsh hand of the military has only been stayed by cooler heads. Pressure from the Emperor has pushed the junta to allow for controlled elections in 1933 in the hope that the veneer of democracy will quell public anger."
  PB_MEX_Revolutionary_Legacy:0 "Legacy of 1878"
  PB_MEX_Revolutionary_Legacy_desc:0 "The Great Northern Revolution, known in Mexico proper as the Great Northern Rebellion, was the collapse of Mexico City's authority in their Northern provinces. The catastrophic defeat of Imperial forces lead to the secession of Tejas, Santa Fe, Rio Grande, Yucatan and California, and destroyed Mexico's repuation as a regional power. Even decades later, the wounds of the 1878 Revolutions are still raw for the Empire, and the reactionary government response drove much of Mexico's scientific and educational talent North to greener pastures."

  mexico.1.t:0 "The Guadalajura Raid"
  mexico.1.d:0 "Very early this morning, a group of criminals broke into the vault of the national bank in Guadalajara. The robbers used the sewer system to get underneath the vault and drill up. When the police arrived in the sewer tunnel, it seemed they’d been working on this for a while as many items could be found down there to indicate that, such as mattresses, food, a couch among other things. \n\After some calculations and administration, it has been calculated that about a hundred thousand pesos has been stolen from the bank. They stayed unnoticed because outside, presumably some friends of the robbers, had caused a scene outside by playing some music and starting some festivities, which took most of the local authorities attention. It is also not known yet whether any of the bank employees were bribed or in on it in any way yet, tomorrow an investigation will be started by the Guadalajara police with aid from the government."
  mexico.1.a:0 "Those scum wil pay!"
  
  mexico.2.t:0 "Yucatan Border Skirmish"
  mexico.2.d:0 "This afternoon a small fire fight broke out between the Yucatani and Mexican border garrison. Sources believe it broke out because one of the Yucatan soldiers stepped on Mexican soil, which has been illegal since a year after their secession from Mexico. The border between our two countries has been closed since that secession, nor is trade allowed. But because of frequent smuggling, refugees and various other reasons, both our countries have agreed to uphold a permanent border garrison on both sides of said border. Although there are diplomatic relations between Yucatan and Mexico, in case of incidents like these, these relations can get heated and create tension in the area between the two armies who are stationed there. Thus far luckily both sides have stayed calm and decided to come to a conclusion together and figure anything out if needed. No one died in the incident and one person was shot in the arm during the fire fight, but he did not have to go to the hospital."
  mexico.2.a:0 "What do they want now?"
  
  mexico.3.t:0 "Uruapan Railway Strike"
  mexico.3.d:0 "Due to heavy rainfall, worthless wages and general spite for their jobs and bosses, railway construction workers decided to go on strike and incite a small revolt just after their lunch breaks. At that time in the day about 9 millimetres of rain had fallen, making it almost impossible to properly construct the railway, but the boss decided it was fine and told them to keep working. They didn’t and started protesting, it was pretty peaceful to begin with until one member broke mentally and punched one of the higher ups who were present. At that moment all hell broke loose. Some of the higher ups started shooting at the dozens of railway workers. This chaos continued till 10 of the workers were either shot or hit in the head with a tool. Despite all this, the railway workers returned later that day to fulfil their quota. Still utterly wet."
  mexico.3.a:0 "That'll teach em!"
  
  mexico.4.t:0 "Como Una Piedra Rodante"
  mexico.4.d:0 "Como Una Piedra Rodante, a new book freshly released by Dylan Villacrés. It almost immediately became a bestseller, and is widely available in most book shops across the country. Although the true meaning of the book is unknown, the story is about a girl who was born into a rich family who loses all their wealth, and by the age of 20 the girl lives on the street like a hobo. Many things happen to her while out there. She is raped by several men, some of which she knew before the collapse of her familys wealth. She also tries to apply for several jobs, but is refused because of her state of life and lack of skills. It is a bumpy ride for the girl, who is clueless of the true meaning of life and death. Nor does she know what happened to her family. She is invisible to the world. It is also unknown whether the story takes place in Mexico and is supposed to reflect upon the country’s current state. A truly compelling story with many twists and turns, perfect for the average reader."
  mexico.4.a:0 "How intriguing!"
  
  mexico.5.t:0 "Ecuadorian Refugees"
  mexico.5.d:0 "With the current ongoing conflict between the Ecuadorian Revolutionaries and the Gran Colombian government many people have decided to flee the country. Some have fled to the Galapagos islands, others have spread out amongst South American countries. Many went to Peru, the Acre Republic and Brazil. But in this case about 150 people together bought a boat and made their way north, hoping to avoid the Gran Colombian pacific fleet. After being successful in doing so they went through a major storm which everyone survived. After 5 days of sea travel they landed on our pacific coast. Where they were welcomed by the locals. The officials there were informed of their arrival and eventually the central government, who decided to officially give asylum to them and any future Ecuadorian refugee who should flee during the war."
  mexico.5.a:0 "All Are Welcome!"
  
  mexico.6.t:0 "Zacatecas Water Crisis"
  mexico.6.d:0 "Near the north of the country, there is a desert region called Zacatecas. Recently because of the extreme Mexican summer heat, wells all throughout the reason have dried up. Many people are fearing a water famine might occur in the region. Already we’re seeing significant negative impact on the area and population because of the drought. A few older people have even died because of dehydration. Plus this will likely lead to a crop failure later down in the year. Though the government hasn’t issued an official response to the matter, it is expected that they will assist the people there within a week or so."
  mexico.6.a:0 "We must help those people!"

  mexico.7.t:0 "New Military Academy"
  mexico.7.d:0 "After much delay, budget cuts and protest by the locals the Toluca Military Academy has finally been built and has gone into use immediately. Many of the locals objected to the construction of the academy, but many people also greatly welcomed the academy. They believe it will bring more prosperity to the region as new soldiers have to spend their days here training. Especially local police chief Mario Murillo was enthusiastic about the coming of the academy as he believes the greatest thing to do is to serve in the army. Head of the Academy is Captain Juan Tassis, a strict and disciplined army veteran who wants to prepare the next generation for the next war."
  mexico.7.a:0 "Good For The Young Folk!"

  mexico.8.t:0 "Jacobin Assasinated"
  mexico.8.d:0 "Much uproar in the port city of Puerto Vallarta today. Because last night influential Jacobin politician Daniel Pardo was assassinated in a bar after getting drunk and getting into a heated argument with some conservative gentlemen about the California Republic. Daniel Pardo believed Mexico and California should unify under the control of Zapatista peacefully. Which the also drunk conservatives highly disagreed with and argued instead that the two nations should go to war once more and unify under the stronger rule of Mexico. After a small brawl one of the gentlemen shot the Jacobin and fled the scene.\n\The killer has not been caught but the police have talked to some of his friends who were there when the murder occured.Daniel Pardo will be buried in his family’s grave in his home town of Colima."
  mexico.8.a:0 "A Blow To The Jacobins!"

  mexico.9.t:0 "The December Reforms"
  mexico.9.d:0 "Now with the harsh summer and rainy fall behind us, we head swiftly into the winter. During which the government has announced several reforms, dubbed the December Reforms.\n\They will be aimed at stopping corruption on the local level by having a different government official every 2 months, which is to stop bribing, check the finances and policies of the local government, and when there is anything off it will be shown to the central government who will investigate the matter. Also in the reforms are included a prolonged police academy program. First to become a police officer you would have to be in the academy for 3 years, this has now been upped to 5 years. Together with this comes a renewed fight against bandits in the countryside who oppress many innocent people yearly. Many say this is the beginning of what good is to come for the people of Mexico. Not everyone is onboard, but virtually everyone is happy that at least something is being done."
  mexico.9.a:0 "Finally Some Good News!"
