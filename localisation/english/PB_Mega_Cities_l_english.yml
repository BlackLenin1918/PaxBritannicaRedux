  Mega_Cities_Idea_Info:0 "§YMegacities§! are definded by their population, typically ranging around the 10 million mark plus. They represent the clustered and frantic nature of capital city life and are both a blessing and curse to live in. A blessing because the sights and wonders are one to many and the abundance of jobs make them a beacon of economical prosperity. And a curse because the surrounding flora and fauna are effectively driven to extinction with only birds and rats making the occasional appearance, that combined with the damaging pollutants makes §YMegacities§! a 'perfect hell' to live in.\n\nThe §YMegacity§! GUI adds gameplay value to capital cities, besides the obvious strategical value. While some nations start with §YMegacities§!, i.e. the UK, France, Germany, and Russia, they can also be founded as a focus, event, or decision effect. The GUI is divided into four sections, the first section being open after the §YMegacity§! is founded. Each section contains one unqiue city spirit which grants, state, or national modifier buffs. The Industrial, Military, and Naval Zones are better than their vanilla counterparts, in efficiency and construction speed. They are also indestructible. Each section must be fully industrialized before unlocking the next following section. Once a section is complete you must procceed in upgrading to the next section, this will take five months to complete at which point a new section will unlock, unless you have completed all four sections.\n\n§RDo note that once you have picked a city spirit, or industrial hub such decisions can't be reversed.§!"

  PB_Mega_City_Idea_One_desc:0 "§YGene Therapy Clinic:§!\n\nHappiness: §G+10%§!\nProductivity: §R-10%§!\nConstructs Free 1 §YMedical Center§! in State\n\nExorbitantly expensive and, at times, even dangerous, genetic therapy is still an emerging science. The wartime practicality of stem cell harvesting and modification for replacement limbs and organs has since given way to civilian usage.\n\nIn the glitz and glamor of Megacity skylines, Gene Therapy clinics offer their clients a myriad of services, ranging from reducing the effects of aging to improving hair growth or the emphasis of certain desirable traits. Unfortunately, a side-effect of such therapies is an increasing dependence on them, often creating unpredictable, malformed and deranged Gene Addicts."

While the concept didn't catch on in most cinemas, the idea of highly exclusive sense theaters became increasingly popular in high society. Divorced from the world in sensory deprivation chambers, viewers experience a variety of chemically and mechanically induced sights, smells and sounds.\n\nWhile quite trendy, these facilities require considerable upkeep and economic support due to their expensive systems and psychoactive requirements."
