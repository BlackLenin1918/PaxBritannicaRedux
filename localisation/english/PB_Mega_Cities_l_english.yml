  Megacity.1.t:0 "LONDON SPRAWL - DOCUMENTATION FILE"
  Megacity.1.d:0 "The exact origin of London's Megacity status is heavily debated by modern sociologists; however it is generally agreed that the population boom of the Second Renaissance marked a critical shift in the city's history. Contemporary London is one of the most populous cities in the world, with the upper canopy of the skyline reaching nearly half a kilometer above ground. London is commonly referred to as a layered megacity, a term that denotes megacities that expand vertically rather than horizontally. Much of the population resides on ground level, or Old London, where pre-Renaissance architecture stands entombed by the upper canopy skyline or displaced by superstructural pillars that hold the former aloft. The Imperial and British Parliaments remain on the ground level as per tradition, despite proposals to relocate them to the upper canopy.\n\nLondon's status as a critical port in Britain and the centerpiece of the British Empire has led to a syncretic population. Following the implementation of Malthusian Sociogenetics laws, immigration became a key part of London's population growth. The population is primarily European, with significant minorities of Africans, Freedmen and Asians.\n\nDue to most of the population living beneath the upper canopy, English architects were forced to seek inventive solutions to the lack of sunlight. Much of London remains in a state of perpetual twilight, leading to significant outbreaks of hypovitaminosis D. By 1921, however, introduction of Vitamin D supplement to city water management successfully reduced hypovitaminosis cases in Old London by 30%.\n\nThe Upper Canopy of London, sometimes called New London, is the least populated section. The altitude of the upper canopy requires many residents to use supplemental oxygen when outdoors, and cool weather clothing is often worn year-round. The canopy is primarily populated by London's upper class and aristocracy, though some only reside there during the Summer. The cost of piping warm water and waste management make the London canopy by far one of the most expensive places to live on Earth."

  Megacity.2.t:0 "NEW PARIS - DOCUMENTATION FILE"
  Megacity.2.d:0 "Prior to the Great War, Paris was one of the critical cultural capitals of Europe. A genuine rival to London and Germania, Paris was once a notable example of horizontal urbanization in megacities. The city grew outwards over the course of the Second Renaissance, as the city center was too honeycombed by the Paris catacomb system to safely support vertical expansion. Pre-War Paris also played host to several notable architectural marvels such as the Eiffel Tower and a reduced size reproduction of the Colossus of Liberty.\n\nThe Great War would, however, be the demise of this iteration of Paris. The city became the only instance of military operations within a megacity when Imperial forces besieged it in 1910. French and German troops fought intense building-to-building battles for nearly three months before the Parisian garrison chose to surrender. Though most of the French forces followed this surrender, a small but notable number fled into the Parisian catacombs to continue fighting. German Tunnelratte forces would fight these partisans for two weeks while peace negotiations went on, ultimately flooding the catacombs with chlorine gas. It was during the occupation that the Eiffel Tower was shelled, resulting in a partial collapse and the deaths of thirty-seven people. Neither the German nor French governments have claimed responsibility for the incident, although German commanders claim the French shelled the tower out of spite upon seeing a German flag flying from it.\n\nAfter the war, the French government was forced to rebuild parts of Paris entirely. Combat and uncontrolled fires leveled whole swathes of the city's historic architecture, leaving tens of thousands homeless. The reconstruction of the city became a centerpiece of the French Popular movement, who sought to rebuild it as a monument to French resilience against the Imperial Powers. Notably, the Eiffel Tower was left damaged to serve as a memorial to the battle itself."
