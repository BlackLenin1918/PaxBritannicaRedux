albania.1.t:0 "Conducting a Census"
albania.1.d:0 "Our officers have come to us with dreadful news. After conducting a census of our military, it appears as if we are missing men. Across our air force, navy, and army, it appears as if one thousand, three hundred, and twenty-one soldiers are gone! This is a massive stain on our international reputation, and a failure that will surely cost some commanders their heads! We will rectify this immediately!"
albania.1.a:0 "Gone with the wind?!"

PB_ALB_Military_Beginning:0 "The Gordian Knot"
PB_ALB_Military_Beginning_desc:0 "Our military is nothing less than a total mess. What else is there to say? The least we can do is check our logistics and reevaluate what went wrong along the way."
PB_ALB_Navy_Begin:0 "Review The Navy"
PB_ALB_Navy_Begin_desc:0 "The existence of our navy is limited to what can lovingly be called a merchant navy, or cynically can be called private and under civilian ownership."
PB_ALB_Navy_Jacobin_Support:0 "Expand The Native Marine Pool"
PB_ALB_Navy_Jacobin_Support_desc:0 "We don't need foreign help, we don't want foreign help, we are Albanians. Even if that means allowing Jacobin elements into our navy, it is better than our military being owned by foreigners!"
PB_ALB_Navy_Autocracy_Support:0 "Model Navy"
PB_ALB_Navy_Autocracy_Support_desc:0 "Currently, our navy is outdated and outclassed. Our Admiralty suggests we allow foreign advisors to advance us into the modern age."
PB_ALB_Navy_Research:0 "Breaking The Earth"
PB_ALB_Navy_Research_desc:0 "We will break ground in naval research, like the waves break across the shore. We will build a navy worthy of being Albanian!"
PB_ALB_Navy_Army_Mix:0 "A Marriage of The Old"
PB_ALB_Navy_Army_Mix_desc:0 "The navy and army, a combination as old as feta and bread. Interbranch connections shall make our military organically connected and stronger than ever!"
PB_ALB_Army_Begin:0 "Review The Army"
PB_ALB_Army_Begin_desc:0 "Our Army has seen better days. Long gone are the days of Skanderbeg and his glorious army. The Albanian military festers with pests and bloodsuckers everywhere inside."
PB_ALB_Army_Jacobin_Support:0 "The More The Merrier"
PB_ALB_Army_Jacobin_Support_desc:0 "Our Army is, uh, notably light on men. Lowering standards for conscription should solve the issue, but experts warn it would allow Jacobins in our army. But who ever listened to the experts?"
PB_ALB_Army_Autocracy_Support:0 "No Country For Old Men"
PB_ALB_Army_Autocracy_Support_desc:0 "Conscripting more men? We could.... But who needs more men when we can make our current men better! How? Don't ask questions you don't want answers to. Back to work, Private!"
PB_ALB_Army_Research:0 "Guns, Guns, And More Guns!"
PB_ALB_Army_Research_desc:0 "To keep up with our enemies, we must stay ahead of them! Otherwise, we will be doomed to another 500 years of subjection."
PB_ALB_Air_Begin:0 "Review The Air Force"
PB_ALB_Air_Begin_desc:0 "Our people have always looked to the skies, and only recently have we been able to make the eagles of yore be rivaled!"
PB_ALB_Air_Jacobin_Support:0 "Women In The Air"
PB_ALB_Air_Jacobin_Support_desc:0 "Bang! Zoom! Straight to the Moon! Women will join men in the air, regardless of how revolutionary it may be!"
PB_ALB_Air_Autocracy_Support:0 "'Women In The Air'"
PB_ALB_Air_Autocracy_Support_desc:0 "Ahahaha! Women in the air, laughable. Maybe if we ever allow civilians on planes, but we all know the air force is just for the military!"
PB_ALB_Air_Research:0 "Tale Of The Eagle"
PB_ALB_Air_Research_desc:0 "The mighty eagle soars! We will nurture our air force like the eagles nurtured our people to greatness!"
PB_ALB_Air_Army_Mix:0 "Marriage of The New"
PB_ALB_Air_Army_Mix_desc:0 "The Air Force is new, but it is our most advanced and modern branch. So why not take a leap of faith and use our Air Force to its fullest extent?"
PB_ALB_Remove_Bad_Spirit:0 "Cheers To Our Boys"
PB_ALB_Remove_Bad_Spirit_desc:0 "We've come a long way since being a couple thousand men short. It's been a long road, but we've done it. By God, we've done it."
