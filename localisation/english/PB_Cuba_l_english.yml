  CUB_theodore_roosevelt_desc: "Seldom can a gifted white elephant be spotted so clearly; however, it’s clear to everyone in the United Commonwealth that the Governorship of Cuba is nothing but a poised chalice that Theodore Roosevelt Jr. has been forced to drink out of.\n\nAs it became known, the Progressive Age was championed by William Jennings Bryan, the longest-serving Prime Minister in the UCA's history. However, his government was only as successful as it was, thanks to Theodore Roosevelt and his clique of progressive MPs leaving the Federalists and joining the Progress Party. After he died in 1919, the natural successor to the movement was his son, Theodore Roosevelt Jr., much akin to his father, Jr. actively fought against Bryan on many of his policies, threatening the integrity of the party and prompting his “promotion” to Governor of Cuba under the guise of “bringing the progressive policies of the mainland to the island”.\n\nDoing the best out of a bad situation, Ted Jr. did exactly what he set out to do, reforming much of the island's legislation and preparing it for self-governance. His efforts made him incredibly popular with the local Cuban population but highly unpopular with the ever-growing Dixie migrants, setting the stage for the next act of his time as Governor, the Coolidge government.\n\nMade to become nothing but a puppet of local business interests, Ted Jr. is stuck in Cuba, unable to resign as that’d be political suicide, but also unable to do anything against the government of the day, stuck in purgatory waiting for free."

  PB_CUB_dixie_come_home: "Dixie Come Home"
  PB_CUB_dixie_come_home_desc: "After being taken from the Mexicans during the collapse of their Empire, Cuba became a destination for Dixies trying to re-create the success of the plantations of old. This practice blew up in the aftermath of the Bryan government, with the Territory of Cuba being exempt from many of the new workers' rights legislation, causing a second boom in Dixie migration.\n\nWith the appointment of Ted Jr. as Governor, things improved for the native Cubans. However, the Coolidge Government quickly restored things to their former glory, empowering the Dixies on the island. This, in turn, has caused a revival in pro-Unification sentiment from both sides of the sea, with the idea of Cuba becoming the next province of the United Commonwealth a goal of the wider Dixie political sphere."

  PB_CUB_theodores_prison: "Theodores Prison"
  PB_CUB_theodores_prison_desc: "What was once a successful appointment to an upcoming political powerhouse, the Governorship of Cuba, has been destructive towards Teddy Roosevelt Jr.'s career, given the position as a gesture of goodwill between American Prime Minister Bryan and Ted Sr., Jr. took the job in stride, making his best effort to set up Cuba for independence, or at most a position of political autonomy within the UCA. However, the rise of the FUP has destroyed all his progress. With Deputy Prime Minister Murray empowering the American Society for Friendship & Prosperity under William Elliott Gonzales, Ted Jr. has become de facto powerless, being kept as governor to avoid his meddling in national politics."

  PB_CUB_war_in_making: "A War In The Making"
  PB_CUB_war_in_making_desc: "Cuba has never been exceptionally stable; however, its internal instability has paled when compared to Nicaragua, especially after the Reforms introduced by its governor. As these have been walked back through, the island has taken a turn for the worse, with Leftist rhetoric taking hold of much of the working class, with the Cuban branch of the Liga Antiimperialista under Antonio Guiteras y Holmes becoming the champions of the anti-American movement within the island.\n\nOrganising raids and attacks on Americans' properties and prominent politicians, the local forces have been able to keep the region stable for the most part. Still, as more and more of its resources are syphoned off towards fighting the guerrillas in Nicaragua, the more the LA grows in power, with many warning Philadelphia that a full-blown Civil War is not far off if nothing is done."
