  PB_QUE_Our_Little_Paradise_desc:0 "The Commonwealth of Quebec stands as a perfect example of enforced loyalty done right, if such a thing even exists. When Great Britian found itself under control of the entirety of the Quebec region and north western plains it now had to tackle the difficult task of suppresing Québécois resentment. Under the Toronto treaty of 1878 Britain granted the Dominion of Quebec almost complete independent sovereignty in a similar vein to the United Commonwealth. From then on Quebec has been one of London's closest supporters of a non-Anglo origin, however there is still those that wish to seek complete seperation from Britain's grasp."
