  ENG_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe United Kingdom§! is the dominant world power in 1933.\n\n A victor in the Great War, Britain retreated into isolationism with the postwar §Y"Long Depression"§! that gripped the global economy. Propping itself up with inter-empire trade, the United Kingdom and her §YImperial Confederation§! have weathered the storm of the interwar relatively unscathed. However, vast speculation bubbles, unstable currency and growing global discontent threaten to undermine Britain's Empire, particularly as tensions continue to rise with the up-and-coming §YAmerican Commonwealth§!.\n\n The United Kingdom now faces threats from a resurgent France and Russia, eager to settle the score from the Great War, as well as conflict within their increasingly precarious Empire and the nation itself.\n\n The United Kingdom is a §YGreat Power§!.\n\n"
  AME_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Commonwealth of America§! is the dominant North American power in 1933 and the seat of British imperial authority on the continent. \n\n Having gained a modicum of independence via the §YGalloway Plan of Union§!, the American Commonwealth has been the right hand of the British Empire for more than a century. \n\n The Commonwealth was the model upon which the system of §YConstituent Commonwealths§! was established, retaining near total independence save for foreign affairs. Though relatively peaceful, the nation's role as the peacekeeper of North America has seen it clash with its' own Southern slave-owning class in the §Y Southern Rebellion§! of the 1800s. Even now, the issue of civil rights is a principle problem for the nation because of the inconsistent segregation laws. \n\n In the years since the Great War, wherein the Commonwealth fought and bled under their own flag for the first time during the Iberian Campaign, America has begun to grow beyond London's dictates. In many ways a §YGreat Power§! in its' own right, the Commonwealth effectively holds Great Britain's import reliant economy hostage at the §YImperial Parliament§!, fostering no small amount of resentment among Britain's imperial elites. With the archaic and contradictory Confederation beginning to seem less and less valuable, the American Commonwealth may soon be in a position to become the master of its' own empire. \n\n The Commonwealth of America is a §YGreat Power§!."
  FRA_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Republic of France§! is a resurgent continental power in Europe in 1933. \n\n France's history is deeply entangled with Europe's history. The liberal constitutionalist reformation followed the §YCrisis of 1798§!, birthing one of Europe's earliest truly parliamentary monarchies. The §YBourbon Dynasty§! once reigned from the shores of Iberia to the swamps of Venezia and beyond, and in their hubris thought to bring down the rising power of Germany. This fatal mistake would ultimately cost the Bourbons their crown, their empire, and lead to the deaths of nearly twenty million people. \n\n §YThe Great War§! ended with the German tricolor flying triumphant over Paris. The humiliating §YTreaty of Tours§! saw the French Empire dismantled, the monarchy formally ended, and a near total demilitarization. Naturally, this so-called Twenty Year Armistice sent France into a sprial of revanchist fervor. In the decades since the end of the war, French politics have become dominated by two main political factions; §YAction Française§! and the §YFrench Popular Front§!. \n\n The former, lead by §YCharles Maurras§!, is a restorationist pro-monarchy party. Technically rendered illegal under the post-war constitution, Maurras' extreme nationalist and Catholic stance have garnered enough support to earn him influence on the National Assembly. The Popular Front, headed by §YJacques Doriot§!, is an ultranationalist authoritarian party seeking revenge against Germany and Britain for their part in the Great War. Forced into a coalition to keep power away from more moderate voices, Doriot and Maurras have begun to increasingly undermine one another in a cynical game for total control. With the left-wing of the Popular Front under §YInessa Armand§! beginning to question Doriot's control, the political scene in France is likely to lead to bloodshed. Regardless of who wins, it seems that the anger of the French people will soon turn East to the moribund German Empire and beyond.\n\n The §YThe Republic of France§! is a §YGreat Power§!"
