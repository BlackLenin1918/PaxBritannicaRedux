  PB_GER_Economic_Depression:0 "The Long Depression"
  PB_GER_Economic_Depression_desc:0 "The interwar years have not been kind to the German Empire. The failed colonialist policies and foreign policy blunders of the Ludendorf government, combined with the immediate economic crash after the end of hostilities in 1910, fermented a general depression across the entire continent. This fermented political instability throughout the Empire, driving away foreign investment and forcing Germany to lean on their internal industries and colonies to survive. This has lead to a Germany dramatically weakened and fermented an unheard of 13% unemployment rate, with poverty running rampant."
  PB_GER_Political_Gridlock:0 "Bundestag Gridlock"
  PB_GER_Political_Gridlock_desc:0 "The ongoing economic crisis has fermented gridlock throughout the Empire's primary legislative body, the Bundestag. The divides between the leftist labour movements and the conservative right have deepened dramatically, preventing meaningful legislative solutions to Germany's myriad of political problems."
  PB_GER_Prussian_Separatism:0 "Prussian Separatism"
  PB_GER_Prussian_Separatism_desc:0 "Since the defeat of the Prussian Kingdom during the Wars of Austrian Consolidation, the Easternmost territories of the Empire remain the most rebellious. Eastern Germany and Prussia remain a hotbed of ultranationalist sentiments, with the Prussian Freikorps, or Free Corps, a constant problem with the local authorities. These hyper-reactionary militias frequently come into conflict with both the police and leftist political leaders, leading Eastern Germany to gain a reputation for being unstable and dangerous."
  PB_GER_Great_War_Victor:0 "Enough Dead Heroes for the End of Time"
  PB_GER_Great_War_Victor_desc:0 "Germany stood among the victors of the Great War, further cementing the nation as one of the preeminent world powers and finally breaking the perfidious Bourbons. Yet, more than a decade later many are still war weary. Germany suffered tremendous losses throughout the war, with millions laying down their lives in the trenches of Flanders and Alsace to achieve victory. Germany took their place in the son, but for many, there are enough dead heroes buried in Flanders' fields for the end of time."

With the economy in shambles, ill-intentioned radicals are stirring up trouble throughout the fatherland. Jacobin revolutionaries speak to packed coffee houses, spouting the doctrine of revolution and socialist utopia. Hardline nationalists pour into the beer halls of Bavaria and Berlin, eager to denounce everything from the Jacobins to the Jews. Outbreaks of political violence are not uncommon and thus far the administration has been unwilling to crack down on them openly for fear of exacerbating the issue."

  germany.1.t:0 "The Kaiser's New Years Address"
  germany.1.d:0 "As the new year begins, celebrations throughout Germany have begun to peeter out. Early in the morning, Kaiser Rudolf II appeared before a gathered crowd in Frankfurt to deliver his new years address. His speech contained little in terms of tangible promises to the people, keeping in line with his generally apolitical stance, but of particular note was his consistent references to the need for \" more modern leadership for the Empire.\"\n\nThese cues, coupled with the Kaiser's general withdrawal from public life, has lead to concerns among the nobility of weakness. Though the Kaiser has rebuffed any concerns from his advisors to the contrary, it has become something of an open secret that the Kaiser has sought retirement from his position for some time. The Kaiser's retreat from publicity has lead to greater indirect power being vested in the hands of the Autonomous Kingdoms, with King Rupprecht of Bavaria supposedly mocking the Kaiser as \"feminine and weak\" for focusing more on his family life.\n\nRegardless, the government does not run on rumors, and Chancellor Stresemann believes that he can finally push his reform plan through the Bundestag this year."
  germany.1.a:0 "Perhaps 1933 will finally be our year..."

  germany.2.t:0 "Bread Riots in the Rhineland"
  germany.2.d:0 "Political violence is not unheard of in Germany, and almost a decade of economic downturn has lead to many instances of rioting. In Koblenz, however, a series of bread riots rapidly got out of control, leading to nearly twenty five deaths and dozens of injured.\n\nRelief efforts in the Rhineland have been ongoing for the last year due to crop failures, and the region continues to suffer from one of the nation's higher poverty rates. According to witnesses, bread being distributed in a poorer neighborhood of Koblenz escalated into violence when bread supplies began to run out. After being denied their ration, reportedly several men assaulted the relief workers before being shot by the police. In the ensuing chaos, four police officers were tackled and beaten while relief offices were ransacked.\n\nMinister-President Goebbels has sent a furious letter to the offices of Frankfurt, demanding the deployment of the Nationalgarde to Koblenz."
  germany.2.a:0 "Goebbels is a hysteric. Absolutely not..."
  germany.2.b:0 "I suppose we could spare some reservists..."

  germany.3.t:0 "The Kaiser calls on Stresemann"
  germany.3.d:0 "Stresemann met with the Kaiser earlier this morning over lunch, and returned to his office visibly shaken. When questioned, he stated that the Kaiser confided in him that he planned to abdicate the throne. According to the Chancellor, the Kaiser was open that the stress of rule and his advancing age had begun to severely affect his health.\n\nHis statements are not without merit, Stresemann stated, as the Kaiser had been hospitalized in 1930 following a bout of pneumonia. Though the incident was largely kept out of the papers, the event had \"made his majesty acutely aware of his mortality.\"\n\nThough there are no legitimate concerns regarding succession, Stresemann believes that the abdication is \"exactly the kind of chaotic mess we can't afford right now.\""

  germany.7.t:0 "The Hirschfeld Institute"
  germany.7.d:0 "The political and social upheaval of the interwar years produced a vibrant community of theorists in Germany. Of particular note was Magnus Hirschfeld, a leading figure in sexual studies. Born in Kolberg, Brandenburg-Prussia, Hirschfeld spent the interwar years pioneering his research of alternative sexuality.\n\nHirschfeld’s most notable work in recent years has been his advocacy for the concept of “spectrum sexuality.” Spectrum Sexuality argues for the idea of gender and sexual preference as a fluid concept and independent of one-another, going against the traditional sexology studies on the subject. In addition to this, Hirschfeld has been a prominent advocate of homosexual rights throughout Germany, often butting heads with more conservatively minded politicians. Up until recently, the Hirschfeld Institute of Sexual Studies has been funded by private investors, however now Hirschfeld himself has approached the German government to seek official support."

  germany.19.d:0 "Shots rang out in the city center of Vienna this afternoon as an unidentified, strangely dressed man suddenly fired on another at a cafe. Before the stranger could escape, he was apprehended by the local police and taken in for questioning. The man he targeted, 44 year old local Adolf Hitler, died from his wounds shortly after the attack. Hitler, a local painter in the Vienna Artist Commune, served a brief term of service in the Reichsheer before being forced to retire due to wounds suffered from a French gas attack\n\nThe unidentified stranger, who spoke with an abnormal German dialect, explained frantically about \"going to the wrong timeline\" and showed investigators a series of photos of what appeared to be people behind barbed wire and some kind of large mushroom-shaped explosion. When it was explained that he would be indicted for murder, the man claimed he \"shouldn't have rounded up his calculations\" before gunning down the two interviewing officers with a hidden automatic pistol and escaping the police station. Police were unable to find where the man had escaped to, but did find that he had left a leather jacket with a few personal affects.\n\nAmong the stranger's possessions was a small black device with a plastic exterior and a button that would open it to reveal a key. Several buttons on the top would cause a small red light to flash as well. The items were handed off to Evidenzburo officials the following day, who plan to continue investigating the bizarre murder."

  germany.41.d:0 "Reichsheer troops descended upon Berlin in force to capture or kill the Berlin Freikorps, a band of Great War veterans and youths responsible for attacking local trade unions and left demonstrations. Our forces were met with sporadic gunfire from the less restrained members, but after a brief standoff their leaders were convinced to stand down and come quietly. The Berlin Freikorps, thankfully, were not suicidal enough to try and test our patience.\n\nRudolf Hess, Great War veteran and leader of the group, offered to testify against other high ranking leaders of the organization in exchange for amnesty. "

  germany.42.t:0 "The Bavarian Freikorps Resist"
  germany.42.d:0 "Reichsheer troops moved into Munich as part of planned operations to capture or eliminate leaders of the Bavarian Freikorps. The Bavarian Freikorps, far better equipped and with significant local support, were anticipated to resist violently. After surrounding several of their hideouts, Freikorps troops opened fire on the Reichsheer with rifles and improvised explosives, causing minor casualties.\n\nAfter pulling back, commanders on the ground have reported the situation back to Frankfurt and are requesting additional support."

  germany.43.t:0 "German Armor in Munich"
  germany.43.d:0 "Upon seeing German Landships moving into the city, the Bavarian Freikorps abandoned their posts and chose to surrender to the Reichsheer division. Ernst Röhm, head of the Bavarian militia, was unwilling to come quietly and was shot dead when the army broke into his office.\n\nThough for the most part the operation was conducted cleanly, Röhm's death has unfortunately turned him into something of a martyr in German nationalist circles. "
  germany.43.a:0 "Intimidation is truly the greatest weapon."
  
  germany.44.t:0 "Bloodbath in Munich"
  germany.44.d:0 "Acting on orders from Frankfurt, the Reichsheer division moved into Munich in force. Without armored support, they suffered significant casualties fighting the Freikorps. Their numbers and superior firepower ultimately ended the street fighting and they succeeded in killing or capturing most of the Freikorps in the city.\n\nUnfortunately, the battle also lead to a number of civilian casualties, as well as a fire which destroyed several residential buildings. In total, the operation lead to the death of approximately sixty three people and almost a million Thaler in damages."

  germany.45.t:0 "The Alsace National Union Falls"
  germany.45.d:0 "The Alsace National Union, at long last, has been crushed by the overwhelming force of the German military. Deployed en masse to the region, German troops located and snuffed out many of the group's hideouts, forcing their leadership to flee to France. Though there may be need to maintain security force deployments in the region for some time, at least for now, the ALNU has been definitively crushed."
  germany.45.a:0 "Burn in hell, French bastards."

  germany.46.t:0 "The Alsace National Union Party"
  germany.46.d:0 "The Alsace National Union Party, founded in 1925 after the ultranationalist coup in France, has been making moves throughout the province to organize anti-German resistance. The group, headed by Henri Barbé, is generally known for their vocal and militant demands for the return of Alsace to the French state. These same notable stances are also what lead to the party being banned by the German government.\n\nDriven underground, the ALNU has become more akin to a terrorist organization. It's an open secret that their funding comes from the French state, and they have used this funding to launch bombings and assassinations across Alsace in an effort to turn public opinion against the German government."
  germany.46.a:0 "You lost the war, get over it."

Some have even mockingly called it politics by assassination, due the myriad of left and right wing political killings since the war's end. While normally this would be an issue to be resolved over time, we must deal with our own internal factionalism if we are to be prepared for the inevitable French attack.\n\n§YEach Mission Completed will reduce the level of political violence.
