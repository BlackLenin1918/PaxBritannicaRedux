  ##########################
  PB_GER_Economic_Depression:0 "The Long Depression"
  PB_GER_Economic_Depression_desc:0 "The interwar years have not been kind to the German Empire. The failed colonialist policies and foreign policy blunders of the Ludendorf government, combined with the immediate economic crash after the end of hostilities in 1910, fermented a general depression across the entire continent. This fermented political instability throughout the Empire, driving away foreign investment and forcing Germany to lean on their internal industries and colonies to survive. This has lead to a Germany dramatically weakened and fermented an unheard of 13% unemployment rate, with poverty running rampant."
  PB_GER_Political_Gridlock:0 "Bundestag Gridlock"
  PB_GER_Political_Gridlock_desc:0 "The ongoing economic crisis has fermented gridlock throughout the Empire's primary legislative body, the Bundestag. The divides between the leftist labour movements and the conservative right have deepened dramatically, preventing meaningful legislative solutions to Germany's myriad of political problems."
  PB_GER_Prussian_Separatism:0 "Prussian Separatism"
  PB_GER_Prussian_Separatism_desc:0 "Since the defeat of the Prussian Kingdom during the Wars of Austrian Consolidation, the Easternmost territories of the Empire remain the most rebellious. Eastern Germany and Prussia remain a hotbed of ultranationalist sentiments, with the Prussian Freikorps, or Free Corps, a constant problem with the local authorities. These hyper-reactionary militias frequently come into conflict with both the police and leftist political leaders, leading Eastern Germany to gain a reputation for being unstable and dangerous."
  PB_GER_Great_War_Victor:0 "Enough Dead Heroes for the End of Time"
  PB_GER_Great_War_Victor_desc:0 "Germany stood among the victors of the Great War, further cementing the nation as one of the preeminent world powers and finally breaking the perfidious Bourbons. Yet, more than a decade later many are still war weary. Germany suffered tremendous losses throughout the war, with millions laying down their lives in the trenches of Flanders and Alsace to achieve victory. Germany took their place in the son, but for many, there are enough dead heroes buried in Flanders' fields for the end of time."

  germany.1.t:0 "The Kaiser's New Years Address"
  germany.1.d:0 "As the new year begins, celebrations throughout Germany have begun to peeter out. Early in the morning, Kaiser Rudolf II appeared before a gathered crowd in Frankfurt to deliver his new years address. His speech contained little in terms of tangible promises to the people, keeping in line with his generally apolitical stance, but of particular note was his consistent references to the need for \" more modern leadership for the Empire.\"\n\nThese cues, coupled with the Kaiser's general withdrawal from public life, has lead to concerns among the nobility of weakness. Though the Kaiser has rebuffed any concerns from his advisors to the contrary, it has become something of an open secret that the Kaiser has sought retirement from his position for some time. The Kaiser's retreat from publicity has lead to greater indirect power being vested in the hands of the Autonomous Kingdoms, with King Rupprecht of Bavaria supposedly mocking the Kaiser as \"feminine and weak\" for focusing more on his family life.\n\nRegardless, the government does not run on rumors, and Chancellor Stresemann believes that he can finally push his reform plan through the Bundestag this year."
  germany.1.a:0 "Perhaps 1933 will finally be our year..."

  germany.2.t:0 "Bread Riots in the Rhineland"
  germany.2.d:0 "Political violence is not unheard of in Germany, and almost a decade of economic downturn has lead to many instances of rioting. In Koblenz, however, a series of bread riots rapidly got out of control, leading to nearly twenty five deaths and dozens of injured.\n\nRelief efforts in the Rhineland have been ongoing for the last year due to crop failures, and the region continues to suffer from one of the nation's higher poverty rates. According to witnesses, bread being distributed in a poorer neighborhood of Koblenz escalated into violence when bread supplies began to run out. After being denied their ration, reportedly several men assaulted the relief workers before being shot by the police. In the ensuing chaos, four police officers were tackled and beaten while relief offices were ransacked.\n\nMinister-President Goebbels has sent a furious letter to the offices of Frankfurt, demanding the deployment of the Nationalgarde to Koblenz."
  germany.2.a:0 "Goebbels is a hysteric. Absolutely not..."
  germany.2.b:0 "I suppose we could spare some reservists..."

  germany.3.t:0 "The Kaiser calls on Stresemann"
  germany.3.d:0 "Stresemann met with the Kaiser earlier this morning over lunch, and returned to his office visibly shaken. When questioned, he stated that the Kaiser confided in him that he planned to abdicate the throne. According to the Chancellor, the Kaiser was open that the stress of rule and his advancing age had begun to severely affect his health.\n\nHis statements are not without merit, Stresemann stated, as the Kaiser had been hospitalized in 1930 following a bout of pneumonia. Though the incident was largely kept out of the papers, the event had \"made his majesty acutely aware of his mortality.\"\n\nThough there are no legitimate concerns regarding succession, Stresemann believes that the abdication is \"exactly the kind of chaotic mess we can't afford right now.\""

  germany.7.t:0 "The Hirschfeld Institute"
  germany.7.d:0 "The political and social upheaval of the interwar years produced a vibrant community of theorists in Germany. Of particular note was Magnus Hirschfeld, a leading figure in sexual studies. Born in Kolberg, Brandenburg-Prussia, Hirschfeld spent the interwar years pioneering his research of alternative sexuality.\n\nHirschfeld’s most notable work in recent years has been his advocacy for the concept of “spectrum sexuality.” Spectrum Sexuality argues for the idea of gender and sexual preference as a fluid concept and independent of one-another, going against the traditional sexology studies on the subject. In addition to this, Hirschfeld has been a prominent advocate of homosexual rights throughout Germany, often butting heads with more conservatively minded politicians. Up until recently, the Hirschfeld Institute of Sexual Studies has been funded by private investors, however now Hirschfeld himself has approached the German government to seek official support."

Though once this decentralized system transformed Germany into a center of political thought and culture, now autonomy has become a crutch for the German state. The ongoing economic depression has reignted nationalism in many of the strongest German states, some of whom have begun to entertain ideas of going it alone again.\n\nIn order to pass meaningful reform and centralize the German government, unrest in the major kingdoms must be kept below §Y50%§! in order to pass §YCentralization Reforms§!.
