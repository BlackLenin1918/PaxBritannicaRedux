rfa.1.t:0 "Volunteers from the GSR Arrive"
rfa.1.d:0 "With war raging against the authoritarians in the West, we have received a number of armed volunteers from the nearby German Socialist Republic! "
rfa.1.a:0 "Welcome, comrades!"

rfa.2.t:0 "Volunteers from the USASR"
rfa.2.d:0 "Further volunteers have arrived from the USASR to support our war effort!"
rfa.2.a:0 "Rally to the flag!"

rfa.3.t:0 "The First Meeting of the Central Committee"
rfa.3.d:0 "With the reactionaries finally defeated and France secured, the provisional Revolutionary Directory has met to establish our new government. Several major power blocs have formed within the revolutionary parties seeking to take power. \n\n The Jacobins, naturally, are seeking to further consolidate their rule over France and remake the nation based on Marxist-Leninist principles. The Anarchists, lead by Claudine Chomat, gained considerable favor during the war for their pushing of workplace democracy and anarchist values. Additionally, the Popular Front has, of course, sought to maintain power, and generally pushes for a more moderate form of socialism than the Vanguardism of the Jacobins."
rfa.3.a:0 "Marcel Déat is elected First General Secretary"
rfa.3.b:0 "Claudine Chomat is elected First General Secretary"
rfa.3.c:0 "Maurice Thorez is elected First General Secretary"
RFA_Jacobins_Chosen.tt:0 "§G The Neo Jacobin Party will become the Ruling Party §!\n"
RFA_Anarchists_Chosen.tt:0 "§G The United Anarchist Party will become the Ruling Party §!\n"
RFA_Moderates_Chosen.tt:0 "§G The Popular Front Party will Remain the Ruling Party §!\n"

rfa.4.t:0 "The Paris Trials"
rfa.4.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Revolution, a significant number of those associated with the NSF and other reactionary parties have been apprehended. This morning, in Paris, all but a small handful were sentenced to either imprisonment or death for a menagerie of crimes. Among those imprisoned was Leon Blum himself, who was sentenced for anti-revolutionary behavior. There have been concerns raised that these trials are merely for show, and are creating a dangerous precedent for the party’s power, but such counter-revolutionary ideals have been largely discounted."
rfa.4.a:0 "Such is the fate of traitors to the people."

rfa.5.t:0 "The Committee for Public Security"
rfa.5.d:0 "Among the many proposals since the establishment of the Central Committee is the establishment of a Committee for Public Security. Such an organization would act to ensure that the French people are not succumbing to reactionary ideas, and would act to deal with any threats to the Republic, whether they be within or without. The Moderates have protested the idea furiously, calling it a glorified secret police force, while the Jacobins believe that such an institution is necessary to protect their newfound revolution."
rfa.5.a:0 "This is a bad idea."
rfa.5.b:0 "An excellent idea!"

rfa.6.t:0 "Proposal on Revolutionary Guards"
rfa.6.d:0 "Another proposal to the Central Committee has been to create a secondary organization to the people’s army, called the Revolutionary Guards. These paramilitaries, made up of enlisted youths and police, would act to maintain order in areas more difficult to administrate. Such an idea has been denounced as terribly authoritarian, but the Jacobins believe that it is necessary for protecting the revolution."
rfa.6.a:0 "This is a bit much..."
rfa.6.b:0 "We should pursue this!"

rfa.7.t:0 "Our Foreign Policy"
rfa.7.d:0 "One of the major things that needs to be done is establishing our policy in regards to Foreign Affairs. The Jacobin faction believes that we should focus on encouraging socialism in not just Europe, but throughout the world. This would allow us to foster better relations with the USASR in particular. On the other hand, the Moderate Socialists believe we should focus on fostering communism in Europe exclusively. This would isolate us from the socialists in South America, but would allow us to focus on developing socialism in one country, rather than misguided ideas of world revolution."
rfa.7.a:0 "Focus on encouraging socialist thought globally."
rfa.7.b:0 "Focus on fostering communist thought in Europe."

rfa.8.t:0 "The Formation of INTERCOM"
rfa.8.d:0 "Having secured their victory in France, the proletarians of Paris have reached out to the USASR seeking an alliance. The International Communist Pact, or INTERCOM, would see us create a mutual defense pact with France. How should we proceed?"
rfa.8.a:0 "Solidarity with our French comrades!"
rfa.8.b:0 "We have no interest in this."

rfa.9.t:0 "Brazil refuses our offer."
rfa.9.d:0 "Brazil has refused our offer of an alliance. We must look elsewhere."
rfa.9.a:0 "Unfortunate."

rfa.10.t:0 "Déat marches on Paris"
rfa.10.d:0 "Backed by the Revolutionary Guards and the Secret Police, Déat has launched a march on Paris to seize power from the Popular Front. Déat’s coup was an almost immediate success, with most of the members of the Popular Front already in custody. The heads of the Party have fled the country to Sicily and beyond, disappearing into the chaos that has engulfed the African continent. Déat, speaking before the former Estates-General, announced himself as the new head of the Central Committee, which will now be staffed solely with members of the Jacobin party."
rfa.10.a:0 "Democracy was overrated anyway."

rfa.11.t:0 "The War on Mysticism Continues"
rfa.11.d:0 "Overzealous revolutionary guards, removing idols of mysticism from a city in the Republic, have clashed with locals. The ensuing conflict and purge of the local population has caused considerable damage to the surrounding region."
rfa.11.a:0 "A price to pay for revolution"

rfa.12.t:0 "The War on Tribalism Continues"
rfa.12.d:0 "Throughout the country, symbols of tribalism have been undone or destroyed. Flags and items not related to the state, or to the French Republic, are being burnt by the revolutionary guards. Thousands of counter-revolutionaries, unwilling to release their reactionary toys, have been apprehended and or purged. Truly a glorious day for the working peoples of France. "
rfa.12.a:0 "There is no nation. Only the state."

rfa.13.t:0 "The War on Falsehoods Continues"
rfa.13.d:0 "Towns and villages throughout the Republic burn as the revolutionary guards seek out and destroy any vestiges of the old republic. Major monuments of the reactionary empire have been either altered or destroyed. The Arc de Triomphe, for example, as been altered to reflect our loving General Secretary, while the Notre Dame Cathedral has been burnt down and demolished entirely to make way for a park for the workers."
rfa.13.a:0 "Reminiscence of the Empire is a capital offense."

rfa.14.t:0 "The Enemy of our Enemy"
rfa.14.d:0 "War has broken out between ourselves and the Central Powers once again. The English, it seems, are in a similar boat. Though we have no love for the reactionaries, it might be a wise idea to seek cooperation with them."
rfa.14.a:0 "Better the English than the Germans"
rfa.14.b:0 "We're better off on our own."

rfa.15.t:0 "Cooperation with the French Communists"
rfa.15.d:0 "With war between ourselves and the Central Powers raging once more, the French Republic has approached us with an offer of a nominal alliance until the war has concluded. While we’ve had our own issues with communists, it cannot be denied that the French could prove a vital ally in the conflict."
rfa.15.a:0 "We'll take them over the krauts."
rfa.15.b:0 "We don't cooperate with communists."

rfa.16.t:0 "The British refuse!"
rfa.16.d:0 "The British have refused our offer of an alliance! We must look elsewhere."
rfa.16.a:0 "Damn."

rfa.17.t:0 "The Trial of Maurice Thorez"
rfa.17.d:0 "Maurice Thorez, leader of the Popular Front, was arrested last night by the Revolutionary Guards for supposed counter-revolutionary activities. Thorez protested the arrest, claiming it was a politically motivated move by the Jacobins to try and discredit him. Brought before the New Revolutionary Courts, Thorez is slated to either be declared guilty and executed or have his sentence commuted."
rfa.17.a:0 "Guilty!"
rfa.17.b:0 "Innocent!"

rfa.18.t:0 "Thorez flees to Switzerland!"
rfa.18.d:0 "After having his sentence commuted, Thorez vanished into the streets of Paris. Despite being tracked by the Ministry and the Revolutionary Guards, he was able to slip through the thinly protected border into neutral Switzerland. The immense failure of the Republican military and the porous nature of the Swiss border has lead to mass purges and reassignments, with new plans to reinforce the Swiss border to prevent further incidents. Thorez has survived, though likely to die in exile, never seeing the fruits of the grand French Revolution."
rfa.18.a:0 "Perhaps a life in exile is punishment enough."

rfa.19.t:0 "An Invitation from France"
rfa.19.d:0 "Having secured their victory in France, the proletarians of Paris have reached out to the GSR seeking an alliance. The European Communist Pact, or EUROCOM, would see us create a mutual defense pact with France. How should we proceed?"
rfa.19.a:0 "A toast to our new French comrades!"
rfa.19.b:0 "We hate capitalists, but we hate the French even more."

rfa.20.t:0 "The GSR Refuses our Alliance"
rfa.20.d:0 "The German Socialist Republic has refused our alliance."
rfa.20.a:0 "Damn!"
