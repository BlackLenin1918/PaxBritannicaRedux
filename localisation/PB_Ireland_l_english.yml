  # IDEAS
  ##########################
  IRE_compromise:0 "The Unhappy Compromises" 
  IRE_compromise_desc:0 "Whilst the Dublin Negotiations were considered fruitful by those in attendance and would eventually lead to the recognition of the Irish Commonwealth, the treaties following the conference have become a subject of criticism from all sides of the political spectrum. Seen as too much compromise by the unionists, too little autonomy by the republicans, the debate has raged for nearly a decade now and grown increasingly radical. Fringe paramilitary organisations have surged in popularity and threaten the fragile Irish state."
  IRE_first_colony:0 "Scars of the 'First Colony'"
  IRE_first_colony_desc:0 "Whilst Ireland now enjoys its Commonwealth status within the British Empire, the legacy of absolute British rule still remains across the island. In agricultural, economic, and societal matters, one need not look far to find the effects of British rule. These scars have divided and radicalized Irish politics, with most people having took part in one radical group or another at some point in their lives. If (or when) war comes, there is no doubt that it shall be bitter and bloody."
  IRE_inexperienced_army:0 "The Green Army"
  IRE_inexperienced_army_desc:0 "The Armed Forces of the Irish Commonwealth were cobbled together following the end of the Great War and the recognition of the Commonwealth. With each appointment to high command being a bitter political issue, the Irish Commonwealth Forces have mockingly earned the nickname of the 'Green Army', not only for the iconic Irish green but also for their lack of experience, or 'greenness'."
  IRE_veterans_association:0 "The Irish Veterans' Association"
  IRE_veterans_association_desc:0 "The Irish Veterans Association, or IVA, was formed immediately following the Great War and creation of the Irish Commonwealth to accommodate the large number of Irish veterans who returned from the frontlines. It helps to rehabilitate veterans into civilian life, many of whom were left homeless thanks to the effects of the Great Depression."
