  ##########################  
  IRE_mac_diarmada_gov:0 "Mac Diarmada's Cabinet"
  IRE_mac_diarmada_gov_desc:0 "The 1932 Elections provided another inconclusive result for the Commonwealth parliament, not quite allowing an IDL victory but failing to deliver Mac Diarmada a conclusive victory. Still, the result cannot be described as disastrous and there remains plenty of work to be done."
  IRE_military_exercises:0 "Permit Independent ICF Exercises"
  IRE_military_exercises_desc:0 "It is no secret that the Irish Commonwealth Forces lack the military experience of other nations, which has left us overly reliant on British arms and experience. By hosting ICF military exercises independent of the British, we can assert the relative independence of the Irish Commonwealth and our growing confidence on the battlefield."
  IRE_industrial_drive:0 "Enact Industrial Promises"
  IRE_political_concessions:0 "Approach the IDL"
  IRE_political_concessions_desc:0 "Appealing to moderate unionists during the campaign, Mac Diarmada made clear his openness to cooperation with the Irish Dominion League on several factors. Whilst many are token issues, buying political favour with some members of the IDL couldn't hurt..."
  IRE_crisis_hits:0 "The Crisis Hits"
  IRE_crisis_hits_desc:0 "The London Stock Crisis has blindsided our government and we expect the next week to be full of difficult decisions..."
  IRE_ohgod:0 "A Crisis of Confidence"
  IRE_ohgod_desc:0 "With our economy entering a seemingly endless downwards spiral, the Irish people are losing confidence in not just the Irish Parliamentary Party but the whole system of Government and Parliament. We must try to win back their support lest they flee to the Radicals."
  IRE_go_alone:0 "The IPP Alone"
  IRE_go_alone_desc:0 "With the IDL remaining uncooperative, despite the current crisis, the IPP must be the ones to carry Ireland through the crisis. Our popularity may be devastated by the next few months but there remains no reason why we should not try..."
  IRE_coalition:0 "An Emergency Coalition"
  IRE_coalition_desc:0 "The current crisis has reminded Parliament that cooperation is necessary for the fragile peace in Ireland to survive. The IDL have compromised and now we must finalise our coalition to prevent the radicals from destroying our Commonwealth."
  IRE_plead_britain:0 "Petition for British Support"
  IRE_plead_britain_desc:0 "Whilst Britain has been devastated by the Stock Crisis, their economy still remains more sturdy and flexible than our own. Even more hardline elements within the IPP recognise that only British Capital can save our economy!"
  IRE_fight_for_IVA:0 "Fight for the IVA"
  IRE_fight_for_IVA_desc:0 "The Irish Veterans Association is a lifeline for thousands, losing it would see them turned out onto the streets. If the IPP could do only one thing, it must be to save this institution."
  IRE_deploy_ICF:0 "Deploy the Commonwealth Forces"
  IRE_deploy_ICF_desc:0 ""
  IRE_Irish_bailout:0 "An Irish Bailout"
  IRE_Irish_bailout_desc:0 "To rely on British support now would be a sign of weakness to the radicals waiting to pounce, the Irish economy must be shown to be independent of Britain as much as is plausible."
  IRE_falls_apart:0 "It Falls Apart"
  IRE_falls_apart_desc:0 "Peace must be preserved!"

  ireland.1.t:0 "The Secession Crisis"
  ireland.1.a:0 "Hold the Line, lads!"
  ireland.1.b:0 "Come out and fight me like a man!" 
  ireland.1.c:0 "The Government has failed us, the Guard must step in!"
  ireland.4.t:0 "Mac Diarmada Approaches the IDL"
  ireland.5.t:0 "Ireland hit by the Crisis!"
  ireland.5.d:0 "The Irish economy, already weakened by its involvement in the Great War, was ill-prepared for the chaos wrought by the London Stock Crisis. With the Commonwealth's economy having been increasingly tangled with Imperial markets, the initial effects of the Crisis have inflicted havoc on the markets!"
  ireland.5.a:0 "We must weather the storm!"
  ireland.6.t:0 "General J. Twaddell Protests ICF Exercises!"
  ireland.6.d:0 "As the extensive two weeks of military exercises for the ICF almost reach their end, General William J. Twaddell of the Ulster Imperial Regiment has launched a fiery attack on the exercises. Speaking to his regiment and limited members of the public, the General decried the exercises as 'a bastion of radical republican activity' where Irish Liberation Forces 'openly fraternised with sympathetic officers'. Whilst he provided no evidence to support these accusations, he went on to claim that the '(Irish Commonwealth) Government's eagerness to conduct exercises without our British Allies could only point to a republican infestation reaching the highest levels'\n\nThe Government has so far offered no response to the accusations but the comments show the sharp division which divides the ICF."
  ireland.6.a:0 "Another rabble rouser..."
  ireland.6.b:0 "Can't we remove this man from command?"
  ireland.7.t:0 "The King is Dead!"
  ireland.7.d:0 "Sombre news arrived from Westminster in the early hours of the morning, announcing the passing of HRH George V due to a sudden illness. The news has, predictably, seen a mixed reception in Ireland. Whilst the official response from the ruling government was limited to a tersely written message of condolences to the heir, Edward VIII, and royal family; The mood on the streets ranged from cautious celebration to outright burning of Royal Portraits.\n\nDespite the best efforts of the Police, manage clashes emerged from between groups of supporters and republicans, with injuries currently steady at the one hundred mark."
  ireland.7.a:0 "Can't say we'll miss him entirely..."
  ireland.8.t:0 "The Way Forward"
  ireland.8.a:0 "The IPP must endure this crisis alone"
  ireland.8.b:0 "Only together will Ireland survive"

  ##########################
  IRE_compromise:0 "The Unhappy Compromises" 
  IRE_compromise_desc:0 "Whilst the Dublin Negotiations were considered fruitful by those in attendance and would eventually lead to the recognition of the Irish Commonwealth, the treaties following the conference have become a subject of criticism from all sides of the political spectrum. Seen as too much compromise by the unionists, too little autonomy by the republicans, the debate has raged for nearly a decade now and grown increasingly radical. Fringe paramilitary organisations have surged in popularity and threaten the fragile Irish state."
  IRE_first_colony:0 "Scars of the 'First Colony'"
  IRE_first_colony_desc:0 "Whilst Ireland now enjoys its Commonwealth status within the British Empire, the legacy of absolute British rule still remains across the island. In agricultural, economic, and societal matters, one need not look far to find the effects of British rule. These scars have divided and radicalized Irish politics, with most people having took part in one radical group or another at some point in their lives. If (or when) war comes, there is no doubt that it shall be bitter and bloody."
  IRE_inexperienced_army:0 "The Green Army"
  IRE_inexperienced_army_desc:0 "The Armed Forces of the Irish Commonwealth were cobbled together following the end of the Great War and the recognition of the Commonwealth. With each appointment to high command being a bitter political issue, the Irish Commonwealth Forces have mockingly earned the nickname of the 'Green Army', not only for the iconic Irish green but also for their lack of experience, or 'greenness'."
  IRE_veterans_association:0 "The Irish Veterans' Association"
  IRE_inexperienced_army2:0 "The Green Army"
  IRE_inexperienced_army2_desc:0 "The Armed Forces of the Irish Commonwealth were cobbled together following the end of the Great War and the recognition of the Commonwealth. With each appointment to high command being a bitter political issue, the Irish Commonwealth Forces have mockingly earned the nickname of the 'Green Army', not only for the iconic Irish green but also for their lack of experience, or 'greenness'."
  IRE_encourage_local_business:0 "Irish Business Initiative"
  IRE_veterans_association_desc:0 "The Irish Veterans Association, or IVA, was formed immediately following the Great War and creation of the Irish Commonwealth to accommodate the large number of Irish veterans who returned from the frontlines. It helps to rehabilitate veterans into civilian life, many of whom were left homeless thanks to the effects of the Great Depression."
