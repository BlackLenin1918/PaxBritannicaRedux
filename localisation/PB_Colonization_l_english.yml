  PB_Western_Colonization:0 "The Great Frontier"
  PB_Western_Colonization_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American Western Territories are one of the few unclaimed lands left on Earth. With the British Empire largely focused on domestic matters and a moribund Mexican Empire facing collapse, meaningful colonization of the Western Frontier has been limited. Technology has made major expansion into the territories possible, and now a race begins to secure the untapped resources of the Old West.\n\n§YOnly one state my be colonized at a time. To begin colonization, select a state from the map and select the decision to begin colonization. Once initial colonization is complete, the colony must be invested in, and then can then be officially annexed.\n\nIf more than one country attempts to colonize a state, whichever country has invested the higher amount of manpower will succeed in colonization.§!"
