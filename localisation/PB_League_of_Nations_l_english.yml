  lon.1.t:0 "The Baltics under Occupation"
  lon.1.d:0 "The collapse of Russian authority in the Baltic states has left the region in disarray. With the League of Nations continuing to push into the Russian heartlands, it is deemed necessary that a provisional reconstruction authority be established out of the former Baltic governate. The Baltic International Reconstruction Authority will work alongside local and national leadership to bring the nation back to a pre-war standard of living and peace.\n\nLeague Forces will also begin the process of apprehending and prosecuting Russian officials involved in the Baltic Governate's atrocities. Already, investigators are finding the bloody evidence of Russia's wartime domestic policies. The attempted Russification of the Baltic under the Russian government has resulted in thousands dead or displaced, with a major chunk of the civilian population suffering from famine conditions.\n\nOnce the Baltic states have been brought back to a point of reasonable sustainability, the mandate will be dissolved in preparation for referendums on maintaining a united Baltic and open democratic elections."
