  PB_POR_chemical_menace:0 "Haunted by Chemicals"
  PB_POR_chemical_menace_desc:0 "During the Iberian campaign of Portugal, the Portuguese youth were eager to jump into the trenches for the Portuguese crown. Blissfully, the youth fought the enemy, until it happened: yellow clouds of toxin reached the Portuguese trenches killing the young boys like flies in a raincloud, dropping by the thousands after every chemical attack. Portuguese revenge for these losses came in the form of failed offensives, losing more young lives. In 1909, Portugal used mustard gas for the first time against the Spanish, but this reprisal for the shock of 1906 was not satisfying for the parents that only received the helmets of their sons. This ‘lost generation’ would become the prime target of anti-war propaganda used by the Republican Party during the Spanish civil war, as to encourage young men not to sign up for the Portuguese expeditionary force in Spain. The people of Portugal have been scarred forever and are still haunted by the yellow ghost of mustard gas."
  PB_POR_forgotten_revolution:0 "The Forgotten Revolution"
  PB_POR_forgotten_revolution_desc:0 "For some, it seemed like the Industrial revolution that expanded European power in the 18th century never reached the shores of Portugal: one of the lowest literacy rates of Europe, a lacking transportation system and almost no industry has left Portugal to be economically unstable to the core. Under Carlos I, Portugal declared bankruptcy thrice and the scramble for Africa has not been worth the extensive investments Portugal has counted on. Portugal will have to solve its economic and technological issue if it wants to remain relevant on the worldstage."
  PB_POR_liberal_menace:0 "Creeping Spectre of the Republicano"
  PB_POR_liberal_menace_desc:0 "Since the enlightenment touched upon Europe and the ideas of monarchy became old-fashioned, republicanist idealism has cursed Portugal. The growing social tension between the working class and the court has, however, not been as dangerous as some other European nations have experienced, as the Republican Party is divided to its core. We should still be carefull for revolution, as the militant enthusiasm of the republicanist are a threat to the monarchy and the catholic ideals Portugal is build upon."
  PB_POR_overstretched_empire:0 "Overstretched Empire"
  PB_POR_overstretched_empire_desc:0 "Since the loss of Brazil in the 1820s, Portugal has been an empire of nothing. The scramble of Africa, however, restored the national identity of Portugal as an exploring colonizing nation and many excited adventurers invested in the new African possessions of portugal. This new empire would last a thousand years! Reality, however, is often disappointing and the investments in Angola, Togo, Mozambique and Morocco never generated profit for Portugal. The military budget skyrocketed with these new territories and with the creation of the Suez canal, trade around the cape of Good Hope and the essential Portuguese profit from this would plummet. Today, Portugal is completely overextended with military posts across the world while its economy can not even support its military at home."
