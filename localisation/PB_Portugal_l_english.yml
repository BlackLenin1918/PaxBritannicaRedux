  PB_POR_chemical_menace:0 "Haunted by Chemicals"
  PB_POR_chemical_menace_desc:0 "During the Iberian campaign of Portugal, the Portuguese youth were eager to jump into the trenches for the Portuguese crown. Blissfully, the youth fought the enemy, until it happened: yellow clouds of toxin reached the Portuguese trenches killing the young boys like flies in a raincloud, dropping by the thousands after every chemical attack. Portuguese revenge for these losses came in the form of failed offensives, losing more young lives. In 1909, Portugal used mustard gas for the first time against the Spanish, but this reprisal for the shock of 1906 was not satisfying for the parents that only received the helmets of their sons. This ‘lost generation’ would become the prime target of anti-war propaganda used by the Republican Party during the Spanish civil war, as to encourage young men not to sign up for the Portuguese expeditionary force in Spain. The people of Portugal have been scarred forever and are still haunted by the yellow ghost of mustard gas."
  PB_POR_forgotten_revolution:0 "The Forgotten Revolution"
  PB_POR_forgotten_revolution_desc:0 "For some, it seemed like the Industrial revolution that expanded European power in the 18th century never reached the shores of Portugal: one of the lowest literacy rates of Europe, a lacking transportation system and almost no industry has left Portugal to be economically unstable to the core. Under Carlos I, Portugal declared bankruptcy thrice and the scramble for Africa has not been worth the extensive investments Portugal has counted on. Portugal will have to solve its economic and technological issue if it wants to remain relevant on the worldstage."
  PB_POR_liberal_menace:0 "Creeping Spectre of the Republicano"
  PB_POR_liberal_menace_desc:0 "Since the enlightenment touched upon Europe and the ideas of monarchy became old-fashioned, republicanist idealism has cursed Portugal. The growing social tension between the working class and the court has, however, not been as dangerous as some other European nations have experienced, as the Republican Party is divided to its core. We should still be carefull for revolution, as the militant enthusiasm of the republicanist are a threat to the monarchy and the catholic ideals Portugal is build upon."
  PB_POR_overstretched_empire:0 "Overstretched Empire"
  PB_POR_overstretched_empire_desc:0 "Since the loss of Brazil in the 1820s, Portugal has been an empire of nothing. The scramble of Africa, however, restored the national identity of Portugal as an exploring colonizing nation and many excited adventurers invested in the new African possessions of portugal. This new empire would last a thousand years! Reality, however, is often disappointing and the investments in Angola, Togo, Mozambique and Morocco never generated profit for Portugal. The military budget skyrocketed with these new territories and with the creation of the Suez canal, trade around the cape of Good Hope and the essential Portuguese profit from this would plummet. Today, Portugal is completely overextended with military posts across the world while its economy can not even support its military at home."

 portugal.1.t:0 "The Portuguese Revolution"
 portugal.1.d:0 "The tension between Republicanist and Monarchist forces have finally burst, as general Henrique Mitchell and the blue forces met with the protestors in Lisbon. The time of peace and negotiations had ended, as Mitchell told his army to open fire on the revolutionaries. At the end, 126 Portuguese republicans, consisting of women and children, died that day. The news spread like wildfire throughout Portugal and republican forces have set aside their differences, joining together in their revolution against the crown of the Braganza dynasty. News from Lisbon and Guarda have already confirmed that republican militants have taken control in the provinces, while the monarchist forces have ralied their banner in Galicia and their stronghold in Algarves. Manuel II has already expressed his shock, dissapointed in both the people of Portugal and his army for letting it get out of hand in such a short period of time."

  POR_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Kingdom of Portugal§! is a secondary power in Europe in 1933.\n\nThe Empire of Portugal ended with the Brazilian war of Independence, as any relevance Portugal had was lost after losing its primary colony of Brazil. The empire went into an economic decline, quickly becoming one of the poorest countries in Europe. During the Great War, Portugal was scared to get entangled into the web of conflict stretched across Europe. However, British pressure and the threat of Spanish dominance forced Portugal into the Great War, becoming the main front of the §YIberian campaign§! that claimed so many innocent, young lives in the grinding machine of war. \n\nPortuguese troops were able to break the Spanish front in 1908, eventually leading to Spain capitulating on the 7th of may, 1910, sparking §Ythe Spanish Civil War§! with the Portguese troops stuck in the middle of it. Portuguese troops had to quickly redeploy to Galicia and the Portuguese-Spanish border, but not before several more young men were taken in front of our very own eyes. \n\nThe end of the Great War would see Portugal returning to its economic instability and colonial ventures, holding onto our relationship with Britain. However, Manuel II had started to create political enemies, such as §YThe Portuguese Republican Party§! and its paramilitary wing §YThe Liberated Youth§!: While enjoying popular support, the Republican Party itself is divided to its core ideologically, based upon a jacobin-liberal split. Only if Portugal would actively be in an international or national crisis, would the Republican party have a chance of challenging Manuel's reign. Still, Portugal's political landscape has been marked with the blood of politicians and monarchs for decades. What could stop that from happening under Manuel II? \n\nThe §YKingdom of Portugal§! is a §Ysecondary power§!"
