  Mega_Cities_Idea_Info:0 "§YMegacities§! are definded by their population, typically ranging around the 10 million mark plus. They represent the clustered and frantic nature of capital city life and are both a blessing and curse to live in. A blessing because the sights and wonders are one to many and the abundance of jobs make them a beacon of economical prosperity. And a curse because the surrounding flora and fauna are effectively driven to extinction with only birds and rats making the occasional appearance, that combined with the damaging pollutants makes §YMegacities§! a 'perfect hell' to live in.\n\nThe §YMegacity§! GUI adds gameplay value to capital cities, besides the obvious strategical value. While some nations start with §YMegacities§!, i.e. the UK, France, Germany, and Russia, they can also be founded as a focus, event, or decision effect. The GUI is divided into four sections, the first section being open after the §YMegacity§! is founded. Each section contains one unqiue city spirit which grants, state, or national modifier buffs. The Industrial, Military, and Naval Zones are better than their vanilla counterparts, in efficiency and construction speed. They are also indestructible. Each section must be fully industrialized before unlocking the next following section. Once a section is complete you must procceed in upgrading to the next section, this will take five months to complete at which point a new section will unlock, unless you have completed all four sections.\n\n§RDo note that once you have picked a city spirit, or industrial hub such decisions can't be reversed.§!"
