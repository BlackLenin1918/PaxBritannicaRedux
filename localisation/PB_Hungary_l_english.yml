  PB_HUN_Revolution_Home:0 "Home of the Revolution"
  PB_HUN_Revolution_Home_desc:0 "The Hungarian People's Republic is the only major revolutionary republic in existence in continental Europe and, if the reactionary powers had their way, it would be the last. Following the Great War, Hungary found itself in crisis. Their allegiance to Germany had cost nearly a million lives, economic collapse and reduced much of the nation to near famine conditions. The touchpaper of Revolution was easily lit in 1912, when the Royal Hungarian Army attempted to crack down on protests in Budapest.\n\nVeteran's militias, trained and hardened by fighting on the Romanian and North Italian fronts, quickly turned the tables on the pro-German protectorate government. Within a matter of days, the nation descended into civil war and revolutionary violence. The regime that emerged from the revolution would be one founded not on Imperial obligations or bourgeois capitalism, but on revolutionary republicanism. Hungary is the vanguard of the revolution in the Balkans, and her people are dedicated to the ideas upon which the new republic was founded."
  PB_HUN_Croatian_Support:0 "Supporting Croatian Rebels"
  PB_HUN_Croatian_Support_desc:0 "The Great War's aftermath saw the Kingdom of the Dinaric, an artificial German protectorate, collapse into ethnic and political violence. Citing Hungary's claims on Croatia, the Hungarian Revolutionary Army moved in to openly support Croatian forces in the region in 1914. This saw the establishment of the Croatian People's Republic, a sister Republic to the one in Budapest and heavily reliant on local Hungarian advisors and economic support. A significant portion of our military is dedicated to supporting the Croatian forces, drawing some resources away from other sectors."
  PB_HUN_Balkan_Powderkeg:0 "The Balkan Powderkeg"
  PB_HUN_Balkan_Powderkeg_desc:0 "The Balkans have always been a region of conflict and the years since the war have seen the region descend into armed camps, mimicking the web of alliances prior to the larger global conflict. With a revanchist Romania and expansionist Serbia, revolutionary fervor in Bulgaria and the Dinarics having split, the Balkans are a single crisis away from exploding into general war. The coming conflict has been predicted by nearly every advisor in every Balkan capital, and thus a palpable sense of tension has overtaken the region. No one knows quite when the Great Balkan War will begin, but everyone is jockeying to be in a position to fire the first shot."
