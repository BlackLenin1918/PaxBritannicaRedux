  FID_Vietminh_desc:0 "The Jungles of Indochina have become host to a widespread resistance movement in the form of the so-called Vietminh. The movement has no formal organization or ideology, and is only united in their efforts to remove French influence from the region. Their disorganization and decentralization have made them a major threat to French authorities in the region, who have spread themselves increasingly thin trying to fight them."
