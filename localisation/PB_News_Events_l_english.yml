  PBNews.1.t:0 "The London Stock Crisis"
  PBNews.1.d:0 "Britain's economic stagnation has finally come to a head. The sudden collapse of the country's investment bubble sparked a panic throughout the British economy, leading to mass panic sales and several of Britain's major Imperial Corporations going under.\n\nMillions have been left unemployed virtually overnight and the British economy is in shambles, sending shockwaves throughout the Imperial Confederation and Britain's few economic partners."
  PBNews.1.a:0 "What does this mean for the Empire?"

  PBNews.2.t:0 "The Arab War of Succession"
  PBNews.2.d:0 "With the death of Ali bin Hussein, Emir of the United Arab Emirates, his line of succession has been disputed. The long running rivalry between the Hashemites and Rashidis has finally erupted into open violence. Claiming legitimacy to the throne, both factions have armed themselves and prepared to seize control.\n\nWith the Middle East in chaos, many observers fear that the ongoing conflicts might foster the rise of new, radical threats to the old order."

  PBNews.3.t:0 "The Occupation of the Netherlands"
  PBNews.3.d:0 "Following extensive negotiations, the Crisis over Holland has come to a close. Despite diplomatic protests, the German delegation conceded the limited occupation of Flanders by French forces in an effort to appease French expansionism. This move proved pointless, however, and French forces simply opted to occupy the remainder of the Netherlands with minimal fighting.\n\nThe delicate concert of Europe, so carefully maintained since the end of the Great War, begins to crack under the pressures of revanchism."
  PBNews.3.a:0 "Bad Things are on the Horizon"

  PBNews.4.t:0 "The South African War"
  PBNews.4.d:0 "With the Netherlands under French occupation, the thin veil of civility has been dropped in the South African Confederacy. The South African republics, previously kept in line by Holland, have turned on one another to finally decide the future of the cape. Two factions, the Alliantie van Democratische Krachten and the Verenigd Front, have formed between the former Dutch possessions.\n\nThe long-term effects of open civil war in Africa remain to be seen, but the conflict is likely to upend much of the old colonial order."
  PBNews.4.a:0 "Where diplomacy has failed, the sword will follow."

  PBNews.5.t:0 "The Cairo Putsch"
  PBNews.5.d:0 "The London Stock Crisis has utterly decimated the British sphere of influence, and has left many of their longtime allies facing mass unrest at home. Few other nations experienced this as acutely as Egypt, and just this morning, that unrest exploded into open revolt. A series of protests in Cairo rapidly broke down when Royal Egyptian troops were ordered to open fire. Instead, they turned their weapons on their commanders and soon, on the Royal Palace itself. With the King now in custody of the military, an uneasy provisional government has been formed between the militarists, clergy and reformists."

  PBNews.6.t:0 "End of the Chinese Revolution"
  PBNews.6.d:0 "The Chinese Civil War has come to an end. Republican forces have been routed and defeated after the fall of their provisional capital in Dali. The Imperial forces have achieved victory, but at an incredible cost. China has been decimated by the conflict, with millions of civilian casualties. Famine, disease and banditry run rampant as the Imperial authorities take stock of their phyrric victory.\n\nDespite this, it remains to be seen if the formerly moribund Qing Empire will be able to weather reconstruction intact."
  PBNews.6.a:0 "Perhaps the Qing aren't doomed?"

  PBNews.7.t:0 "Victory of the Chinese Revolution"
  PBNews.7.d:0 "The Chinese Civil War has come to an end. Republican forces have soundly defeated the Qing Empire and successfully taken control of Beijing. The fall of the Manchu monarchy was predicted by many outside observers for nearly a decade since the end of the Great War. Even still, many are shocked to see the end of Imperial China.\n\nOne of the oldest and most ancient states in the world has been toppled by populist revolution, and the international community waits to see what will come of the new provisional government."
  PBNews.7.a:0 "The Future of China is uncertain."

  PBNews.8.t:0 "The Accession of Kaiserin Elisabeth"
  PBNews.8.d:0 "The abdication of Kaiser Rudolf came as a shock to the people of Germany. Though many criticized the Kaiser's rule for his refusal to take a more prominent stance in politics, his status as the son of Franz Joseph earned him a begrudging respect.\n\nNow, his only daughter Archduchess Elisabeth Marie has succeeded him as the Kaiserin of Germany. Cornoated in a lavish ceremony in Frankfurt, the new Kaiserin has drawn some controversy from conservatives in the Empire for her open support of Stresemann's socialist government. "
  PBNews.8.a:0 "What does the future hold for Germany?"

  PBNews.9.t:0 "The Accession of Kaiser Georg"
  PBNews.9.d:0 "The abdication of Kaiser Rudolf came as a shock to the people of Germany. More surprising was the choice for his successor, Prince Georg of Bavaria. A devout Catholic and military figure, the Bavarian prince was an unlikely choice for the throne of the German state. For many, his accession indicates a noticeable shift in imperial power from Vienna to Munich.\n\nCoronated in a lavish ceremony in Frankfurt, the new Kaiser has quickly drawn the ire of the left-wing Bundestag for his more conservative leanings."

  PBNews.10.t:0 "Tories win Re-Election in Britain"
  PBNews.10.d:0 "Though many believed that the Tories would be swept out of power by the stock crisis, it seems Eden's party has managed to narrowly maintain their majority in parliament. Having defeated the upstart NPP and WUP, the Tories have, at least for now, defended their control of the British government.\n\nNow, it falls to the Tory party leadership to choose a new Prime Minister and form their government. With many blaming the Stock Crisis on Anthony Eden, it seems unlikely he will return to the Prime Ministership."
  PBNews.10.a:0 "Good luck to them."

  PBNews.11.t:0 "Worker's Unionists Elected in Britain"
  PBNews.11.d:0 "The so-called \"Grand Coalition\" that was the legacy of Anthony Eden has been shattered. Now, the Worker's Unionist Party stands with a majority in the parliament after a stunning snap election victory. A big tent coalition of democratic socialists, Bakuninists, and state socialists, the WUP has long been relegated to minorities in parliament.\n\nHaving finally seized their chance to form a new government, many are eager to see what Britain's new left-wing government has planned."
  PBNews.11.a:0 "A New Direction for the Empire?"

  PBNews.12.t:0 "National Party Elected in Britain"
  PBNews.12.d:0 "Though some thought that the fall of the Eden government would turn Britain away from conservatism, it seems the opposite has happened. The National People's Party, a fringe right wing party, has managed to exploit the collapse of the Tory coalition and achieve a majority in parliament.\n\nCampaigning on the restoration of traditional British values, the NPP promises grand reforms to the British people and the Empire."
  PBNews.12.a:0 "Interesting times we live in."

  PBNews.13.t:0 "The Edwardian Restoration"
  PBNews.13.d:0 "For the first time in living memory, British troops march through the streets of London. In the dead of the night, a clique of British officers, spurred on by the economic crisis and parliamentary gridlock, rose up and seized the apparatus of state.\n\nIt soon became apparent that the coup had been, if not orchestrated, than at least supported by current King-Emperor Edward. As the new regime consolidates power, elements of the former Parliament have vowed to resist the new regime with all available methods."

  PBNews.14.t:0 "The French Republic Falls"
  PBNews.14.d:0 "The French Republic has been plagued by violence and instability since it was first conceived after the Treaty of Tours. Now, the final nail has been driven into France's failed experiment with Republican democracy.\n\nJacques Doriot, the head of the ultranationalist French Popular Party, launched a violent coup against the other nationalist parties, officially consolidating his rule over the nation. With his first move being the abolition of the Tours Constitution, Doriot's ambition to restore French continental dominance is clear."

  PBNews.15.t:0 "The Second French Empire"
  PBNews.15.d:0 "The French Republic has been plagued by violence and instability since it was first conceived after the Treaty of Tours. Now, the final nail has been driven into France's failed experiment with Republican democracy.\n\nCharles Maurras, leader of the restorationist Action Française, has seized control of the Republic following an aborted coup by Jacques Doriot. With his control of the new state now consolidated, Maurras has declared his intention to restore the Bourbon monarchy and reclaim Frace's former glory."

  PBNews.16.t:0 "The French National Revolution"
  PBNews.16.d:0 "The French Republic has been plagued by violence and instability since it was first conceived after the Treaty of Tours. Now, the final nail has been driven into France's failed experiment with Republican democracy.\n\nInessa Armand, head of the Left-Nationalist faction of the FPP, has seized control of the French state following a failed coup by party head Jacques Doriot. Armand has announced the formation of a new French state based on her ideals of Sorelianism and National Syndicalism, pivoting the FPP in a dramatically more revolutionary direction."

  PBNews.19.t:0 "The Nicaragua Canal"
  PBNews.19.d:0 "The Nicaragua Canal Project, one of the most ambitious projects in recent memory, has finally been completed. Spanning across the small Central American nation, the Canal has created a much more efficient path for trade between Atlantic and Pacific. The project, initially proposed by German architect Herman Sörgel, began in 1925 as a way to bolster Britain's stagnant economy.\n\nThe British Empire now controls both major canals connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, further consolidating their global economic hegemony."
