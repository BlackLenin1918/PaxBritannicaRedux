  PBNews.1.d:0 "Britain's economic stagnation has finally come to a head. The sudden collapse of the country's investment bubble sparked a panic throughout the British economy, leading to mass panic sales and several of Britain's major Imperial Corporations going under.\n\nMillions have been left unemployed virtually overnight and the British economy is in shambles, sending shockwaves throughout the Imperial Confederation and Britain's few economic partners."

  PBNews.2.d:0 "With the death of Ali bin Hussein, Emir of the United Arab Emirates, his line of succession has been disputed. The long running rivalry between the Hashemites and Rashidis has finally erupted into open violence. Claiming legitimacy to the throne, both factions have armed themselves and prepared to seize control.\n\nWith the Middle East in chaos, many observers fear that the ongoing conflicts might foster the rise of new, radical threats to the old order."

  PBNews.3.d:0 "Following extensive negotiations, the Crisis over Holland has come to a close. Despite diplomatic protests, the German delegation conceded the limited occupation of Flanders by French forces in an effort to appease French expansionism. This move proved pointless, however, and French forces simply opted to occupy the remainder of the Netherlands with minimal fighting.\n\nThe delicate concert of Europe, so carefully maintained since the end of the Great War, begins to crack under the pressures of revanchism."

  PBNews.4.d:0 "With the Netherlands under French occupation, the thin veil of civility has been dropped in the South African Confederacy. The South African republics, previously kept in line by Holland, have turned on one another to finally decide the future of the cape. Two factions, the Alliantie van Democratische Krachten and the Verenigd Front, have formed between the former Dutch possessions.\n\nThe long-term effects of open civil war in Africa remain to be seen, but the conflict is likely to upend much of the old colonial order."

  PBNews.5.d:0 "The London Stock Crisis has utterly decimated the British sphere of influence, and has left many of their longtime allies facing mass unrest at home. Few other nations experienced this as acutely as Egypt, and just this morning, that unrest exploded into open revolt. A series of protests in Cairo rapidly broke down when Royal Egyptian troops were ordered to open fire. Instead, they turned their weapons on their commanders and soon, on the Royal Palace itself. With the King now in custody of the military, an uneasy provisional government has been formed between the militarists, clergy and reformists."

Though many criticized the Kaiser's rule for his refusal to take a more prominent stance in politics, his status as the son of Franz Joseph earned him a begrudging respect.\n\nNow, his only daughter Archduchess Elisabeth Marie has succeeded him as the Kaiserin of Germany. Cornoated in a lavish ceremony in Frankfurt, the new Kaiserin has drawn some controversy from conservatives in the Empire for her open support of Stresemann's socialist government. "

A devout Catholic and military figure, the Bavarian prince was an unlikely choice for the throne of the German state. For many, his accession indicates a noticeable shift in imperial power from Vienna to Munich.\n\nCoronated in a lavish ceremony in Frankfurt, the new Kaiser has quickly drawn the ire of the left-wing Bundestag for his more conservative leanings."

The move has seen mixed reactions, as other cliques denounced the move as simply a regression to pre-revolutionary politics.\n\nEmperor Pu Yi, newly restored to his throne, is for the moment a mere puppet of warlord interests. Should this faction regain control, China will once more be dominated by the Imperial dynasty, for better or worse."

  PBNews.52.d:0 "Following a series of military engagements, a coalition of warlord forces lead by General Yan Xishan have taken Beijing and, with it, assumed leadership of China. Yan Xishan remains an enigma in warlord politics, having previously supported the NRA. Now, leading a nascent Chinese statelet, he has taken the opportunity to fully embrace his doctrine of Yan Xishan thought.\n\nPushing for a mix of traditionalism and progress, Yan Xishan's China is a contradiction, but for now it is at least a mostly stable contradiction."

Li's clique of hardline nationalists represent a significant far right turn for the Chinese state.\n\nA firm adherent of Revolutionary Nationalism, Li's clique takes heavy influence from the French State, particularly the policies of the Armandist Left Nationalists. How this doctrine will manifest in China is already evident, as Li's forces unleash a massive purge of former warlord elements."
