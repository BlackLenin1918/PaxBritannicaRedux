  PBNews.1.t:0 "The London Stock Crisis"
  PBNews.1.d:0 "Britain's economic stagnation has finally come to a head. The sudden collapse of the country's investment bubble sparked a panic throughout the British economy, leading to mass panic sales and several of Britain's major Imperial Corporations going under.\n\nMillions have been left unemployed virtually overnight and the British economy is in shambles, sending shockwaves throughout the Imperial Confederation and Britain's few economic partners."

  PBNews.2.t:0 "The Arab War of Succession"
  PBNews.2.d:0 "With the death of Ali bin Hussein, Emir of the United Arab Emirates, his line of succession has been disputed. The long running rivalry between the Hashemites and Rashidis has finally erupted into open violence. Claiming legitimacy to the throne, both factions have armed themselves and prepared to seize control.\n\nWith the Middle East in chaos, many observers fear that the ongoing conflicts might foster the rise of new, radical threats to the old order."

  PBNews.3.t:0 "The Occupation of the Netherlands"
  PBNews.3.d:0 "Following extensive negotiations, the Crisis over Holland has come to a close. Despite diplomatic protests, the German delegation conceded the limited occupation of Flanders by French forces in an effort to appease French expansionism. This move proved pointless, however, and French forces simply opted to occupy the remainder of the Netherlands with minimal fighting.\n\nThe delicate concert of Europe, so carefully maintained since the end of the Great War, begins to crack under the pressures of revanchism."

  PBNews.4.t:0 "The South African War"
  PBNews.4.d:0 "With the Netherlands under French occupation, the thin veil of civility has been dropped in the South African Confederacy. The South African republics, previously kept in line by Holland, have turned on one another to finally decide the future of the cape. Two factions, the Alliantie van Democratische Krachten and the Verenigd Front, have formed between the former Dutch possessions.\n\nThe long-term effects of open civil war in Africa remain to be seen, but the conflict is likely to upend much of the old colonial order."

  PBNews.5.t:0 "The Cairo Putsch"
  PBNews.5.d:0 "The London Stock Crisis has utterly decimated the British sphere of influence, and has left many of their longtime allies facing mass unrest at home. Few other nations experienced this as acutely as Egypt, and just this morning, that unrest exploded into open revolt. A series of protests in Cairo rapidly broke down when Royal Egyptian troops were ordered to open fire. Instead, they turned their weapons on their commanders and soon, on the Royal Palace itself. With the King now in custody of the military, an uneasy provisional government has been formed between the militarists, clergy and reformists."

  PBNews.6.d:0 "The Chinese Civil War has come to an end. Republican forces have been routed and defeated after the fall of their provisional capital in Dali. The Imperial forces have achieved victory, but at an incredible cost. China has been decimated by the conflict, with millions of civilian casualties. Famine, disease and banditry run rampant as the Imperial authorities take stock of their phyrric victory.\n\nDespite this, it remains to be seen if the formerly moribund Qing Empire will be able to weather reconstruction intact."

  PBNews.7.t:0 "Victory of the Chinese Revolution"
  PBNews.7.d:0 "The Chinese Civil War has come to an end. Republican forces have soundly defeated the Qing Empire and successfully taken control of Beijing. The fall of the Manchu monarchy was predicted by many outside observers for nearly a decade since the end of the Great War. Even still, many are shocked to see the end of Imperial China.\n\nOne of the oldest and most ancient states in the world has been toppled by populist revolution, and the international community waits to see what will come of the new provisional government."

  PBNews.8.t:0 "The Accession of Kaiserin Elisabeth"
  PBNews.8.d:0 "The abdication of Kaiser Rudolf came as a shock to the people of Germany. Though many criticized the Kaiser's rule for his refusal to take a more prominent stance in politics, his status as the son of Franz Joseph earned him a begrudging respect.\n\nNow, his only daughter Archduchess Elisabeth Marie has succeeded him as the Kaiserin of Germany. Cornoated in a lavish ceremony in Frankfurt, the new Kaiserin has drawn some controversy from conservatives in the Empire for her open support of Stresemann's socialist government. "

  PBNews.9.t:0 "The Accession of Kaiser Georg"
  PBNews.9.d:0 "The abdication of Kaiser Rudolf came as a shock to the people of Germany. More surprising was the choice for his successor, Prince Georg of Bavaria. A devout Catholic and military figure, the Bavarian prince was an unlikely choice for the throne of the German state. For many, his accession indicates a noticeable shift in imperial power from Vienna to Munich.\n\nCoronated in a lavish ceremony in Frankfurt, the new Kaiser has quickly drawn the ire of the left-wing Bundestag for his more conservative leanings."

  PBNews.10.d:0 "Though many believed that the Tories would be swept out of power by the stock crisis, it seems the late Douglas Haig's party has managed to narrowly maintain their majority in parliament. Having defeated the upstart NPP and WUP, the Tories have, at least for now, defended their control of the British government.\n\nNow, it falls to the Tory party leadership to choose a new Prime Minister and form their government. With many blaming the Stock Crisis on Haig, it seems a change in course for the tories is necessary."

  PBNews.11.d:0 "The so-called \"Grand Coalition\" that was the legacy of Douglas Haig has been shattered. Now, the Worker's Unionist Party stands with a majority in the parliament after a stunning snap election victory. A big tent coalition of democratic socialists, Bakuninists, and state socialists, the WUP has long been relegated to minorities in parliament.\n\nHaving finally seized their chance to form a new government, many are eager to see what Britain's new left-wing government has planned."

  PBNews.12.d:0 "Though some thought that the fall of the Haig government would turn Britain away from conservatism, it seems the opposite has happened. The National People's Party, a fringe right wing party, has managed to exploit the collapse of the Tory coalition and achieve a majority in parliament.\n\nCampaigning on the restoration of traditional British values, the NPP promises grand reforms to the British people and the Empire."

  PBNews.13.d:0 "For the first time in living memory, British troops march through the streets of London. In the dead of the night, a clique of British officers, spurred on by the economic crisis and parliamentary gridlock, rose up and seized the apparatus of state.\n\nIt soon became apparent that the coup had been, if not orchestrated, than at least supported by current King-Emperor Edward.

The project, initially proposed by German architect Herman Sörgel, began in 1925 as a way to bolster Britain's stagnant economy.\n\nThe British Empire now controls both major canals connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, further consolidating their global economic hegemony."

With the fall of their emergency capital, the Ottoman Sultan has fled abroad alongside those members of the government not captured.\n\nThe Council for National Salvation has achieved their victory, but at tremendous cost.

Yan Xishan remains an enigma in warlord politics, having previously supported the NRA. Now, leading a nascent Chinese statelet, he has taken the opportunity to fully embrace his doctrine of Yan Xishan thought.\n\nPushing for a mix of traditionalism and progress, Yan Xishan's China is a contradiction, but for now it is at least a mostly stable contradiction."

  PBNews.53.d:0 "Following a series of military engagements, a coalition of warlord forces lead by Commissar Dai Li have taken Beijing and, with it, assumed leadership of China. Li's clique of hardline nationalists represent a significant far right turn for the Chinese state.\n\nA firm adherent of Revolutionary Nationalism, Li's clique takes heavy influence from the French State, particularly the policies of the Armandist Left Nationalists. How this doctrine will manifest in China is already evident, as Li's forces unleash a massive purge of former warlord elements."

  PBNews.54.d:0 "Following a series of military engagements, a coalition of warlord forces lead by General Feng Yuxiang have taken Beijing and, with it, assumed leadership of China. A firm adherent of the NRA's constitutionalist faction, Feng's leadership has seen a return of many former NRA administrators.\n\nThough military rule continues for the moment, the likelihood of a return to genuine constitutional democracy seems likely if Feng's dogma is to be believed. Perhaps Generalissimo Cai's Revolution was not all for nothing."
