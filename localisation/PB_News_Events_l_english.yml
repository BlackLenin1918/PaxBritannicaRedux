  PBNews.1.t:0 "The London Stock Crisis"
  PBNews.1.d:0 "Britain's economic stagnation has finally come to a head. The sudden collapse of the country's investment bubble sparked a panic throughout the British economy, leading to mass panic sales and several of Britain's major Imperial Corporations going under.\n\nMillions have been left unemployed virtually overnight and the British economy is in shambles, sending shockwaves throughout the Imperial Confederation and Britain's few economic partners."

  PBNews.2.t:0 "The Arab War of Succession"
  PBNews.2.d:0 "With the death of Ali bin Hussein, Emir of the United Arab Emirates, his line of succession has been disputed. The long running rivalry between the Hashemites and Rashidis has finally erupted into open violence. Claiming legitimacy to the throne, both factions have armed themselves and prepared to seize control.\n\nWith the Middle East in chaos, many observers fear that the ongoing conflicts might foster the rise of new, radical threats to the old order."

  PBNews.3.t:0 "The Occupation of the Netherlands"
  PBNews.3.d:0 "Following extensive negotiations, the Crisis over Holland has come to a close. Despite diplomatic protests, the German delegation conceded the limited occupation of Flanders by French forces in an effort to appease French expansionism. This move proved pointless, however, and French forces simply opted to occupy the remainder of the Netherlands with minimal fighting.\n\nThe delicate concert of Europe, so carefully maintained since the end of the Great War, begins to crack under the pressures of revanchism."

  PBNews.4.t:0 "The South African War"
  PBNews.4.d:0 "With the Netherlands under French occupation, the thin veil of civility has been dropped in the South African Confederacy. The South African republics, previously kept in line by Holland, have turned on one another to finally decide the future of the cape. Two factions, the Alliantie van Democratische Krachten and the Verenigd Front, have formed between the former Dutch possessions.\n\nThe long-term effects of open civil war in Africa remain to be seen, but the conflict is likely to upend much of the old colonial order."
  PBNews.4.a:0 "Where diplomacy has failed, the sword will follow."

  PBNews.5.t:0 "The Cairo Putsch"
  PBNews.5.d:0 "The London Stock Crisis has utterly decimated the British sphere of influence, and has left many of their longtime allies facing mass unrest at home. Few other nations experienced this as acutely as Egypt, and just this morning, that unrest exploded into open revolt. A series of protests in Cairo rapidly broke down when Royal Egyptian troops were ordered to open fire. Instead, they turned their weapons on their commanders and soon, on the Royal Palace itself. With the King now in custody of the military, an uneasy provisional government has been formed between the militarists, clergy and reformists."
