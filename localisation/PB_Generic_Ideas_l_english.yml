  PB_Idea_Untamed_Frontier_desc:0 "The Western frontier of North America is, in some ways, one of the last untamed lands on Earth. Though it has been settled, vast territories of the region remain untappped by industrialization. Times are changing, however, and the relentless march of industry continues. Every day new rail lines are laid down, every day another mine or oil concern opens, and every day the West becomes less wild."
